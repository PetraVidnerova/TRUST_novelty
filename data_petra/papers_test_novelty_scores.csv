Proliferative cells are confined to crypts, while differentiated cell types predominantly occupy the villi. We recently demonstrated the existence of a long-lived pool of cycling stem cells defined by Lgr5 expression and intermingled with post-mitotic Paneth cells at crypt bottoms. We have now determined a gene signature for these Lgr5 stem cells. One of the genes within this stem cell signature is the Wnt target Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2). Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and ectopic crypts on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the Lgr5 stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we describe DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a p53 target gene encoding a lysosomal protein that induces macroautophagy, as an effector of p53-mediated death. We show that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM-dependent manner and, while overexpression of DRAM alone causes minimal cell death, DRAM is essential for p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of DRAM in primary tumors revealed frequent decreased expression often accompanied by retention of wild-type p53.

Its activation requires the binding of both glutamate and a coagonist like d-serine to its glycine site. As d-serine is released exclusively by astrocytes, we studied the physiological impact of the glial environment on NMDA receptor-dependent activity and plasticity. To this end, we took advantage of the changing astrocytic ensheathing of neurons occurring in the supraoptic nucleus during lactation. We provide direct evidence that in this hypothalamic structure the endogenous coagonist of NMDA receptors is d-serine and not glycine. Consequently, the degree of astrocytic coverage of neurons governs the level of glycine site occupancy on the NMDA receptor, thereby affecting their availability for activation and thus the activity dependence of long-term synaptic changes. Such a contribution of astrocytes to synaptic metaplasticity fuels the emerging concept that astrocytes are dynamic partners of brain signaling. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report that in response to type 1 interferon (IFNα), IFNα receptors recruit cytoplasmic CREB-binding protein (CBP). By binding to IFNαR2 within the region where two adjacent proline boxes bear phospho-Ser364 and phospho-Ser384, CBP acetylates IFNαR2 on Lys399, which in turn serves as the docking site for interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). IRF9 interacts with the acetyl-Lys399 motif by means of its IRF homology2 (IH2) domain, leading to formation of the ISGF3 complex that includes IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2. All three components are acetylated by CBP. Remarkably, acetylation within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of both IRF9 and STAT2 is critical for the ISGF3 complex activation and its associated antiviral gene regulation.

We identified the voltage-dependent glutamate transporter Slc1a1 as one of the miR-183/96/182 targets in photoreceptor cells. We found that microRNAs in retinal neurons decay much faster than microRNAs in nonneuronal cells. The high turnover is also characteristic of microRNAs in hippocampal and cortical neurons, and neurons differentiated from ES cells in vitro.

Importantly, these neo-generated β-like cells are functional and can repeatedly reverse chemically induced diabetes in vivo. Similarly, the treatment of transplanted human islets with GABA results in a loss of α cells and a concomitant increase in β-like cell counts, suggestive of α-to-β-like cell conversion processes also in humans.

Here, experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these variants.

Here we report that chronic inactivity homeostatically increases action potential duration by changing alternative splicing of BK channels; this requires nuclear export of the splicing factor Nova-2. Inactivity and Nova-2 relocation were connected by a novel synapto-nuclear signaling pathway that surprisingly invoked mechanisms akin to Hebbian plasticity: Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor upregulation, L-type Ca2+ channel activation, enhanced spine Ca2+ transients, nuclear translocation of a CaM shuttle, and nuclear CaMKIV activation. These findings not only uncover commonalities between homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity but also connect homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.

In a screen for neuronal Ca2+ sensors that respond to changes in [Ca2+] with markedly slower kinetics than synaptotagmin I, we observed that Doc2 - another Ca2+, SNARE, and lipid-binding protein - operates on timescales consistent with asynchronous release. Moreover, up- and downregulation of Doc2 expression levels in hippocampal neurons increased or decreased, respectively, the slow phase of synaptic transmission. Synchronous release, when triggered by single action potentials, was unaffected by manipulation of Doc2 but was enhanced during repetitive stimulation in Doc2 knockdown neurons, potentially due to greater vesicle availability.

How intrinsic cell polarization is achieved is poorly understood.

During chromosome segregation, polar PopZ captures the ParB•ori complex and thereby anchors sister chromosomes at opposite poles. This step is essential for stabilizing bipolar gradients of a cell division inhibitor and setting up division near midcell. PopZ also affects polar stalk morphogenesis and mediates the polar localization of the morphogenetic and cell cycle signaling proteins CckA and DivJ. Polar accumulation of PopZ, which is central to its polarizing activity, can be achieved independently of division and does not appear to be dictated by the pole curvature.

However, little is known about the detailed kinetics and coordination of the underlying substrate-processing steps of the proteasome, and their correlation with observed conformational states. Here, we used reconstituted 26S proteasomes with unnatural amino-acid-attached fluorophores in a series of FRET- and anisotropy-based assays to probe substrate-proteasome interactions, the individual steps of the processing pathway, and the conformational state of the proteasome itself. We develop a complete kinetic picture of proteasomal degradation, which reveals that the engagement steps prior to substrate commitment are fast relative to subsequent deubiquitination, translocation, and unfolding. Furthermore, we find that non-ideal substrates are rapidly rejected by the proteasome, which thus employs a kinetic proofreading mechanism to ensure degradation fidelity and substrate prioritization.

How these proteins are organized to produce endocytic vesicles with high precision and efficiency is not understood. Here, we developed high-throughput superresolution microscopy to reconstruct the nanoscale structural organization of 23 endocytic proteins from over 100,000 endocytic sites in yeast. We found that proteins assemble by radially ordered recruitment according to function. WASP family proteins form a circular nanoscale template on the membrane to spatially control actin nucleation during vesicle formation. Mathematical modeling of actin polymerization showed that this WASP nano-template optimizes force generation for membrane invagination and substantially increases the efficiency of endocytosis. Such nanoscale pre-patterning of actin nucleation may represent a general design principle for directional force generation in membrane remodeling processes such as during cell migration and division.

Here, we observe increased mortality in mice coinfected with the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) and West Nile virus (WNV). This enhanced susceptibility is associated with altered gut morphology and transit, translocation of commensal bacteria, impaired WNV-specific T cell responses, and increased virus infection in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. These outcomes were due to type 2 immune skewing, because coinfection in Stat6−/− mice rescues mortality, treatment of helminth-free WNV-infected mice with interleukin (IL)-4 mirrors coinfection, and IL-4 receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells mediates the susceptibility phenotypes. Moreover, tuft cell-deficient mice show improved outcomes with coinfection, whereas treatment of helminth-free mice with tuft cell-derived cytokine IL-25 or ligand succinate worsens WNV disease. Thus, helminth activation of tuft cell-IL-4-receptor circuits in the gut exacerbates infection and disease of a neurotropic flavivirus. Desai et al. show that the tuft cell/IL-4Rα circuit in the intestine can have detrimental consequences in the context of helminth and viral coinfection.

Improved understanding of the roles that super-enhancers play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying super-enhancers across the spectrum of human cell types. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. We produce a catalog of super-enhancers in a broad range of human cell types and find that super-enhancers associate with genes that control and define the biology of these cells. Interestingly, disease-associated variation is especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, we find that cancer cells generate super-enhancers at oncogenes and other genes important in tumor pathogenesis.

However, the molecular mechanism of release has been controversial. Here, we report two kinetically distinct modes of nonvesicular, channel-mediated glutamate release. The fast mode requires activation of Gαi, dissociation of Gβγ, and subsequent opening of glutamate-permeable, two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1 through direct interaction between Gβγ and N terminus of TREK-1. The slow mode is Ca2+ dependent and requires Gαq activation and opening of glutamate-permeable, Ca2+-activated anion channel Best1. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrate that TREK-1 is preferentially localized at cell body and processes, whereas Best1 is mostly found in microdomains of astrocytes near synapses.

As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be “silently” spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.

However, previous findings from bats have questioned these proposals by reporting absence of theta rhythmicity in bat hippocampal formation. Does this mean that temporal coding is unique to rodent hippocampus and does not generalize to other species? Here, we report that, surprisingly, bat hippocampal neurons do exhibit temporal coding similar to rodents, albeit without any continuous oscillations at the 1–20 Hz range. Bat neurons exhibited very strong locking to the non-rhythmic fluctuations of the field potential, such that neurons were synchronized together despite the absence of oscillations. Further, some neurons exhibited “phase precession” and phase coding of the bat's position—with spike phases shifting earlier as the animal moved through the place field. This demonstrates an unexpected type of neural coding in the mammalian brain—nonoscillatory phase coding—and highlights the importance of synchrony and temporal coding for hippocampal function across species. Measurements in freely moving bats reveal that hippocampal neurons encode the animal's position through temporal coding but in the absence of the oscillations observed in rodents.",bats; comparative neurobiology; entorhinal cortex; grid cells; hippocampus; interneurons; neural coding; phase precession; place cells; theta oscillation,Eliav T.; Geva-Sagiv M.; Yartsev M.M.; Finkelstein A.; Rubin A.; Las L.; Ulanovsky N.,54.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2018,8,0.48356503,0.42055073,0.41086936,0.439287,0.4234388,0.025662908718099675,0.48622972,0.43504095,0.011309563645133802,0.31592557,0.4799304,0.11473315590114364,0.50720245,0.35348225,0.0537243947551343,0.57646513,0.35375601053237915,-0.18428942561149597

Here, we describe a family of proteins in yeast (ARTs, for arrestin-related trafficking adaptors) that function by targeting specific PM proteins to the endocytic system. Two members (Art1 and Art2) of the family were discovered in chemical-genetic screens, and they direct downregulation of distinct amino acid transporters triggered by specific stimuli. Sequence analysis revealed a total of nine ART family members in yeast. In addition to similarity to arrestins, the ARTs each contain multiple PY motifs. These motifs are required for recruitment of the Rsp5/Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligase, which modifies the cargoes as well as the ARTs. As a result, ubiquitinated cargoes are internalized and targeted to the vacuole (lysosome) for degradation. We propose that ARTs provide a cargo-specific quality-control pathway that mediates endocytic downregulation by coupling Rsp5/Nedd4 to diverse plasma membrane proteins. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

DsbB is an E. coli membrane protein that oxidizes DsbA, a periplasmic dithiol oxidase. To gain insight into disulfide bond formation, we determined the crystal structure of the DsbB-DsbA complex at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure of DsbB revealed four transmembrane helices and one short horizontal helix juxtaposed with Cys130 in the mobile periplasmic loop. Whereas DsbB in the resting state contains a Cys104-Cys130 disulfide, Cys104 in the binary complex is engaged in the intermolecular disulfide bond and captured by the hydrophobic groove of DsbA, resulting in separation from Cys130. This cysteine relocation prevents the backward resolution of the complex and allows Cys130 to approach and activate the disulfide-generating reaction center composed of Cys41, Cys44, Arg48, and ubiquinone.

Loss of the reading frame through spontaneous frameshifting occurs with a frequency of one in 30,000 amino acid incorporations. However, at many recoding sites, the mechanism that controls reading frame maintenance is switched off. One such example is the programmed +1 frameshift site of the prfB gene encoding the termination factor RF2, in which slippage into the forward frame by one nucleotide can attain an efficiency of ∼100%, namely, four orders of magnitude higher than normally observed. Here, using the RF2 frameshift window, we demonstrate that premature release of the E site tRNA from the ribosome is coupled with high-level frameshifting.

In vertebrate cells, Ro binds misfolded small RNAs and likely functions in RNA quality control. In eukaryotes and bacteria, Ro also associates with small RNAs called Y RNAs. We present structures of unliganded Ro and Ro complexed with two RNAs at 1.95 and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. Ro consists of a von Willebrand factor A domain and a doughnut-shaped domain composed of HEAT repeats. In the complex, a fragment of Y RNA binds on the outer surface of the HEAT-repeat ring, and single-stranded RNA binds in the toroid hole. Mutagenesis supports a binding site for misfolded RNAs that encompasses both sites, with a single-stranded end inserted into the toroid cavity.

Such regulatory modules confer the ability to control different combinations of processes depending on condition or context. These properties likely contribute to the evolutionary maintenance of paralogs and indicate a way in which signaling pathways connect for multiprocess control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",CELLBIO; SIGNALING,Van Wageningen S.; Kemmeren P.; Lijnzaad P.; Margaritis T.; Benschop J.J.; De Castro I.J.; Van Leenen D.; Groot Koerkamp M.J.A.; Ko C.W.; Miles A.J.; Brabers N.; Brok M.O.; Lenstra T.L.; Fiedler D.; Fokkens L.; Aldecoa R.; Apweiler E.; Taliadouros V.; Sameith K.; Van De Pasch L.A.L.; Van Hooff S.R.; Bakker L.V.; Krogan N.J.; Snel B.; Holstege F.C.P.,74.0,10900956.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2010,8,0.78202593,0.544677,0.55314016,0.78691643,0.4286028,0.058264173894921334,0.6116983,0.47392607,0.08374767767104968,0.6073814,0.39288318,0.0653466992485871,0.33630496,0.34083438,0.06709284789268394,0.62613904,-0.146185964345932,0.11438677459955215

Place cells, spatially selective hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using the relative reward value of cues to define continuous “paths” through an abstract value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space through value place fields, much like a rodent's place neurons encode paths through physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed but also became increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized.

Here, we show that a plant virus-encoded protein re-localizes from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts upon activation of plant defense, interfering with the chloroplast-dependent anti-viral salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Strikingly, we have found that plant pathogens from different kingdoms seem to have convergently evolved to target chloroplasts and impair SA-dependent defenses following an association with membranes, which relies on the co-existence of two subcellular targeting signals, an N-myristoylation site and a chloroplast transit peptide. This pattern is also present in plant proteins, at least one of which conversely activates SA defenses from the chloroplast. Taken together, our results suggest that a pathway linking plasma membrane to chloroplasts and activating defense exists in plants and that such pathway has been co-opted by plant pathogens during host-pathogen co-evolution to promote virulence through suppression of SA responses. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Unrelated effector proteins from viral and bacterial pathogens infecting plants co-opt an endogenous pathway to dynamically translocate from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts in the host cell and suppress salicylic-acid-dependent plant defence responses",chloroplast; defense; effector; geminivirus; pathogen; plant; plasma membrane; retrograde signaling; salicylic acid; virus,Medina-Puche L.; Tan H.; Dogra V.; Wu M.; Rosas-Diaz T.; Wang L.; Ding X.; Zhang D.; Fu X.; Kim C.; Lozano-Duran R.,82.0,738540339.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2020,8,0.74178636,0.5512501,0.49907675,0.7510764,0.46655416,0.07468549909591288,0.35671115,0.46590447,0.07750590002026458,0.6249373,0.41375935,0.1040966591103969,0.41719896,0.37082934,0.03524915477014817,0.42899203,0.09470981359481812,0.36227330565452576

Cells often delay replication in the face of stressful conditions, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate in Caulobacter crescentus that proteotoxic stress induces a cell-cycle arrest by triggering the degradation of DnaA, the conserved replication initiator. A depletion of available Hsp70 chaperone, DnaK, either through genetic manipulation or heat shock, induces synthesis of the Lon protease, which can directly degrade DnaA. Unexpectedly, we find that unfolded proteins, which accumulate following a loss of DnaK, also allosterically activate Lon to degrade DnaA, thereby ensuring a cell-cycle arrest.

These elements contain cryptic splice sites, so they are in constant danger of aberrant incorporation into mature transcripts. Despite posing a major threat to transcriptome integrity, little is known about the molecular mechanisms preventing their inclusion. Here, we present a mechanism for protecting the human transcriptome from the aberrant exonization of transposable elements. Quantitative iCLIP data show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNP C competes with the splicing factor U2AF65 at many genuine and cryptic splice sites. Loss of hnRNP C leads to formation of previously suppressed Alu exons, which severely disrupt transcript function. Minigene experiments explain disease-associated mutations in Alu elements that hamper hnRNP C binding. Thus, by preventing U2AF65 binding to Alu elements, hnRNP C plays a critical role as a genome-wide sentinel protecting the transcriptome.

We show here that components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery are involved in PcG-mediated silencing at Fab-7 and in the production of small RNAs at transgenic Fab-7 copies. In general, these mutations do not affect the recruitment of PcG components, but they are specifically required for the maintenance of long-range contacts between Fab-7 copies. Dicer-2, PIWI, and Argonaute1, three RNAi components, frequently colocalize with PcG bodies, and their mutation significantly reduces the frequency of PcG-dependent chromosomal associations of endogenous homeotic genes.

Src-phosphorylated p27 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 poorly in vitro, and Src transfection reduces p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes.

Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this peptide has an optimal binding register for diabetogenic HLA-DQ8. In concordance, a synthetic version of the peptide forms stable DQ8 complexes and potently stimulates autoreactive CD4 T cells from T1D patients, but not healthy controls.

Myocardial Vegf-a or endocardial Vegfr-2 deletion inhibited coronary angiogenesis and arterial formation by ventricular endocardial cells. In contrast, lineage and knockout studies showed that endocardial cells make a small contribution to the coronary veins, the formation of which is independent of myocardial-to-endocardial Vegf signaling.

Gene deletion experiments showed that efficient duplication of telomeres requires the shelterin component TRF1. Without TRF1, telomeres activate the ATR kinase in S phase and show a fragile-site phenotype in metaphase. Single-molecule analysis of replicating telomeres showed that TRF1 promotes efficient replication of TTAGGG repeats and prevents fork stalling.

Growing bacteria release muropeptide fragments of the cell wall into the extracellular milieu, and we report here that these muropeptides are potent germinants of dormant Bacillus subtilis spores. The ability of a muropeptide to act as a germinant is determined by the identity of a single amino acid. A well-conserved, eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr membrane kinase containing an extracellular domain capable of binding peptidoglycan is necessary for this response, and a small molecule that stimulates related eukaryotic kinases is sufficient to induce germination. Another small molecule, staurosporine, that inhibits related eukaryotic kinases blocks muropeptide-dependent germination.

Analysis of single- and multiple-AGO mutant strains reveals functions in several pathways, including (1) chromosome segregation, (2) fertility, and (3) at least two separate steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that RDE-1 interacts with trigger-derived sense and antisense RNAs to initiate RNAi, while several other AGO proteins interact with amplified siRNAs to mediate downstream silencing.

By stabilizing the receptor with a single-domain antibody fragment (“nanobody”) discovered using a synthetic yeast-displayed library, we determined the crystal structure of active-state human AT1R bound to an AngII analog with partial agonist activity. The nanobody binds to the receptor's intracellular transducer pocket, stabilizing the large conformational changes characteristic of activated GPCRs. The peptide engages the AT1R through an extensive interface spanning from the receptor core to its extracellular face and N terminus, remodeling the ligand-binding cavity. Remarkably, the mechanism used to propagate conformational changes through the receptor diverges from other GPCRs at several key sites, highlighting the diversity of allosteric mechanisms among GPCRs.

All rights reserved.Oncogenic activation of RAS genes via point mutations occurs in 20%-30% of human cancers. The development of effective RAS inhibitors has been challenging, necessitating new approaches to inhibit this oncogenic protein. Functional studies have shown that the switch region of RAS interacts with a large number of effector proteins containing a common RAS-binding domain (RBD). Because RBD-mediated interactions are essential for RAS signaling, blocking RBD association with small molecules constitutes an attractive therapeutic approach. Here, we present evidence that rigosertib, a styryl-benzyl sulfone, acts as a RAS-mimetic and interacts with the RBDs of RAF kinases, resulting in their inability to bind to RAS, disruption of RAF activation, and inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway. We also find that ribosertib binds to the RBDs of Ral-GDS and PI3Ks.

Conversely, mice with an epidermal deletion of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) factor, a negative regulator of HIF, have increased EPO synthesis and polycythemia.

Although these tail-anchored (TA) proteins serve numerous essential roles in cells, components of their targeting and insertion pathways have long remained elusive. Here we reveal a cytosolic TMD recognition complex (TRC) that targets TA proteins for insertion into the ER membrane. The highly conserved, 40 kDa ATPase subunit of TRC (which we termed TRC40) was identified as Asna-1. TRC40/Asna-1 interacts posttranslationally with TA proteins in a TMD-dependent manner for delivery to a proteinaceous receptor at the ER membrane. Subsequent release from TRC40/Asna-1 and insertion into the membrane depends on ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, an ATPase-deficient mutant of TRC40/Asna-1 dominantly inhibited TA protein insertion selectively without influencing other translocation pathways.

In vivo cell lineage tracing with constitutive and lineage-specific fluorescent reporters demonstrated that GSCs generate the majority of vascular pericytes. Selective elimination of GSC-derived pericytes disrupts the neovasculature and potently inhibits tumor growth. Analysis of human GBM specimens showed that most pericytes are derived from neoplastic cells. GSCs are recruited toward endothelial cells via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and are induced to become pericytes predominantly by transforming growth factor β. Thus, GSCs contribute to vascular pericytes that may actively remodel perivascular niches.

Our work suggests an important structural role for the Rvbs and a distinct substrate-handling mode by SWR1, thereby providing a structural framework for understanding the complex dimer-exchange reaction. © 2013 The Authors.",,Nguyen V.Q.; Ranjan A.; Stengel F.; Wei D.; Aebersold R.; Wu C.; Leschziner A.E.,78.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,0.67532957,0.5149912,0.5307584,0.5603151,0.50575095,0.09889798608061029,0.7152944,0.45269132,0.08567969575205303,0.44112632,0.33632517,0.0845015554124795,0.6392338,0.3750906,0.03878935997324923,0.57874,0.5314242839813232,-0.29160645604133606

An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one's own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals. When two animals interact, neural activity across their brains synchronizes in a way that predicts how they will behave and how they form social dominance relationships.",calcium imaging; hyperscanning; interbrain synchrony; miniscope; mouse; mPFC; neural circuit; prefrontal cortex; social behavior; social dominance,Kingsbury L.; Huang S.; Wang J.; Gu K.; Golshani P.; Wu Y.E.; Hong W.,46.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,8,0.6624298,0.49285287,0.50349236,0.70131284,0.3927456,0.015761037878992745,0.23511574,0.41797805,0.026400410609549674,0.5740668,0.32471907,0.07546871178343156,0.37377757,0.14907992,-0.021230660673021706,0.44765773,-0.527148425579071,-0.8486514687538147

The process of abstraction solves this by constructing variables describing features shared by different instances, reducing dimensionality and enabling generalization in novel situations. Here, we characterized neural representations in monkeys performing a task described by different hidden and explicit variables. Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training, which requires a particular geometry of neural representations. Neural ensembles in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and simulated neural networks simultaneously represented multiple variables in a geometry reflecting abstraction but that still allowed a linear classifier to decode a large number of other variables (high shattering dimensionality).

Because of deviation from icosahedral symmetry, KSHV portal and tegument structures have largely been obscured in previous studies. Using symmetry-relaxed cryo-EM, we determined the in situ structure of the KSHV portal and its interactions with surrounding capsid proteins, CATCs, and the terminal end of KSHV's dsDNA genome. Our atomic models of the portal and capsid/CATC, together with visualization of CATCs’ variable occupancy and alternate orientation of CATC-interacting vertex triplexes, suggest a mechanism whereby the portal orchestrates procapsid formation and asymmetric long-range determination of CATC attachment during DNA packaging prior to pleomorphic tegumentation/envelopment.

However, CENP-A is not sufficient to drive full-kinetochore assembly, and it is not clear how centromeric chromatin is established. Here, we identify CENP-W as a component of the DNA-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins. We demonstrate that CENP-W forms a DNA-binding complex together with the CCAN component CENP-T. This complex directly associates with nucleosomal DNA and with canonical histone H3, but not with CENP-A, in centromeric regions. CENP-T/CENP-W functions upstream of other CCAN components with the exception of CENP-C, an additional putative DNA-binding protein. Our analysis indicates that CENP-T/CENP-W and CENP-C provide distinct pathways to connect the centromere with outer kinetochore assembly.

Our results indicate that prokaryotes possess a unique RNA silencing system that functions by homology-dependent cleavage of invader RNAs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In quiescent cells, the primary cilium insulates itself from contiguous dynamic membrane processes on the cell surface to function as a stable signaling apparatus. Here, we demonstrate that basal restriction of ciliary structure dynamics is established by the cilia-enriched phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, Inpp5e. Growth induction displaces ciliary Inpp5e and accumulates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in distal cilia. This change triggers otherwise-forbidden actin polymerization in primary cilia, which excises cilia tips in a process we call cilia decapitation. While cilia disassembly is traditionally thought to occur solely through resorption, we show that an acute loss of IFT-B through cilia decapitation precedes resorption. Finally, we propose that cilia decapitation induces mitogenic signaling and constitutes a molecular link between the cilia life cycle and cell-division cycle. This newly defined ciliary mechanism may find significance in cell proliferation control during normal development and cancer.","AurA; cell-cycle entry; decapitation; disassembly; ectosome; extracellular vesicles; F-actin; genetically encoded ciliary actin inhibitor; Gli; Inpp5e; PI(4,5)P2; Primary cilia",Phua S.C.; Chiba S.; Suzuki M.; Su E.; Roberson E.C.; Pusapati G.V.; Setou M.; Rohatgi R.; Reiter J.F.; Ikegami K.; Inoue T.,61.0,727195659.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2017,8,0.93995297,0.5546407,0.5529316,0.87532085,0.48671877,0.08931298393965859,0.73030466,0.42153692,0.07244413478899103,0.5000175,0.34506786,0.05909714901889507,0.6050085,0.42162013,0.08315714950431696,0.53594464,0.21203890442848206,0.19571466743946075

The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP, the downstream target of the tumor-suppressive Hippo-signaling pathway regulates miRNA biogenesis in a cell-density-dependent manner. At low cell density, nuclear YAP binds and sequesters p72 (DDX17), a regulatory component of the miRNA-processing machinery. At high cell density, Hippo-mediated cytoplasmic retention of YAP facilitates p72 association with Microprocessor and binding to a specific sequence motif in pri-miRNAs. Inactivation of the Hippo pathway or expression of constitutively active YAP causes widespread miRNA suppression in cells and tumors and a corresponding posttranscriptional induction of MYC expression. Thus, the Hippo pathway links contact-inhibition regulation to miRNA biogenesis and may be responsible for the widespread miRNA repression observed in cancer.

A widespread assumption is that the leading edge prevents formation of additional fronts by generating long-range diffusible inhibitors or by sequestering essential polarity components. We use morphological perturbations, cell-severing experiments, and computational simulations to show that diffusion-based mechanisms are not sufficient for long-range inhibition by the pseudopod. Instead, plasma membrane tension could serve as a long-range inhibitor in neutrophils. We find that membrane tension doubles during leading-edge protrusion, and increasing tension is sufficient for long-range inhibition of actin assembly and Rac activation. Furthermore, reducing membrane tension causes uniform actin assembly. We suggest that tension, rather than diffusible molecules generated or sequestered at the leading edge, is the dominant source of long-range inhibition that constrains the spread of the existing front and prevents the formation of secondary fronts.

Following UV exposure, epidermal keratinocytes synthesize proopiomelanocortin (POMC) that is processed to melanocyte-stimulating hormone, inducing tanning. We show that, in rodents, another POMC-derived peptide, β-endorphin, is coordinately synthesized in skin, elevating plasma levels after low-dose UV. Increases in pain-related thresholds are observed and reversed by pharmacologic opioid antagonism. Opioid blockade also elicits withdrawal signs after chronic UV exposure. This effect was sufficient to guide operant behavioral choices to avoidance of opioid withdrawal (conditioned place aversion). These UV-induced nociceptive and behavioral effects were absent in β-endorphin knockout mice and in mice lacking p53-mediated POMC induction in epidermal keratinocytes. Although primordial UV addiction, mediated by the hedonic action of β-endorphin and anhedonic effects of withdrawal, may theoretically have enhanced evolutionary vitamin D biosynthesis, it now may contribute to the relentless rise in skin cancer incidence in humans.

The mechanism by which MHC class I molecules select optimal peptides against a background of prevailing suboptimal peptides and in a considerably proteolytic ER environment remained unknown. Here, we identify protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme critical to the formation of correct disulfide bonds in proteins, as a component of the peptide-loading complex. We show that PDI stabilizes a peptide-receptive site by regulating the oxidation state of the disulfide bond in the MHC peptide-binding groove, a function that is essential for selecting optimal peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human cytomegalovirus US3 protein inhibits CD8+ T cell recognition by mediating PDI degradation, verifying the functional relevance of PDI-catalyzed peptide editing in controlling intracellular pathogens.

The cytoskeleton is central to the process but its role in symmetry breaking is poorly understood. We study cell polarization when fission yeast cells exit starvation. We show that the basis of polarity generation is de novo sterol biosynthesis, cell surface delivery of sterols, and their recruitment to the cell poles. This involves four phases occurring independent of the polarity factor cdc42p. Initially, multiple, randomly distributed sterol-rich membrane (SRM) domains form at the plasma membrane, independent of the cytoskeleton and cell growth. These domains provide platforms on which the growth and polarity machinery assembles. SRM domains are then polarized by the microtubule-dependent polarity factor tea1p, which prepares for monopolar growth initiation and later switching to bipolar growth.

We show that the heart regulates systemic energy homeostasis via MED13, a subunit of the Mediator complex, which controls transcription by thyroid hormone and other nuclear hormone receptors. MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. Cardiac-specific overexpression of MED13 or pharmacologic inhibition of miR-208a in mice confers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Conversely, genetic deletion of MED13 specifically in cardiomyocytes enhances obesity in response to high-fat diet and exacerbates metabolic syndrome. The metabolic actions of MED13 result from increased energy expenditure and regulation of numerous genes involved in energy balance in the heart.

We demonstrate here that cellular cholesterol levels in dividing T cells are maintained in part through reciprocal regulation of the LXR and SREBP transcriptional programs. T cell activation triggers induction of the oxysterol-metabolizing enzyme SULT2B1, consequent suppression of the LXR pathway for cholesterol transport, and promotion of the SREBP pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Ligation of LXR during T cell activation inhibits mitogen-driven expansion, whereas loss of LXRβ confers a proliferative advantage. Inactivation of the sterol transporter ABCG1 uncouples LXR signaling from proliferation, directly linking sterol homeostasis to the antiproliferative action of LXR. Mice lacking LXRβ exhibit lymphoid hyperplasia and enhanced responses to antigenic challenge, indicating that proper regulation of LXR-dependent sterol metabolism is important for immune responses.

Here we identify a Bacillus subtilis mutant σA that is independently capable of specific binding and melting of the promoter DNA. Interestingly, specific and independent promoter binding of σ is sufficient for the temperature- and Mg2+-independent melting of promoter DNA around the transcription start site, in contrast to the temperature- and Mg2+-dependent melting by RNAP around the promoter -10 element. Thus core RNAP is able to negatively modulate the σ-initiated melting of the transcription start site and, by sensing the changes in temperature and Mg2+ concentration, to regulate the efficiency of promoter -10 melting. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The region that shows the strongest interaction with actin is an amphipathic N-terminal α helix, present in all β-thymosin/WH2 domains, which recognizes the ATP bound actin structure and uses the shear motion of actin linked to ATP hydrolysis to control polymerization. Crystallographic ( 1H, 15N), NMR, and mutagenetic data reveal that the weaker interaction of the C-terminal region of β-thymosin/WH2 domain with actin accounts for the switch in function from inhibition to promotion of actin assembly.",,Hertzog M.; Van Heijenoort C.; Didry D.; Gaudier M.; Coutant J.; Gigant B.; Didelot G.; Preat T.; Knossow M.; Guittet E.; Carlier M.-F.,65.0,1019333.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2004,7,1.0037402,0.56692183,0.5946392,1.0087242,0.47507942,0.07392256925555346,0.66408503,0.464468,0.05406884437462395,0.62382424,0.375404,0.07098768374441528,0.76469207,0.33241248,0.04653036609614636,0.67677855,0.5314062237739563,0.30143430829048157

Centromere identity and inheritance require the assembly of nucleosomes containing the CenH3 histone variant in place of canonical H3. Although H3 nucleosomes wrap DNA in a left-handed manner and induce negative supercoils, we show here that CenH3 nucleosomes reconstituted from Drosophila histones induce positive supercoils. Furthermore, we show that CenH3 likewise induces positive supercoils in functional centromeres in vivo, using a budding yeast minichromosome system and temperature-sensitive mutations in kinetochore proteins. The right-handed wrapping of DNA around the histone core implied by positive supercoiling indicates that centromere nucleosomes are unlikely to be octameric and that the exposed surfaces holding the nucleosome together would be available for kinetochore protein recruitment. The mutual incompatibility of nucleosomes with opposite topologies could explain how centromeres are efficiently maintained as unique loci on chromosomes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that, in the mammalian small intestine, the expression of Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthetase 2), the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of ketone bodies, including beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), distinguishes self-renewing Lgr5+ stem cells (ISCs) from differentiated cell types. Hmgcs2 loss depletes βOHB levels in Lgr5+ ISCs and skews their differentiation toward secretory cell fates, which can be rescued by exogenous βOHB and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment. Mechanistically, βOHB acts by inhibiting HDACs to reinforce Notch signaling, instructing ISC self-renewal and lineage decisions. Notably, although a high-fat ketogenic diet elevates ISC function and post-injury regeneration through βOHB-mediated Notch signaling, a glucose-supplemented diet has the opposite effects.

We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with optogenetic activation and silencing to study the mechanisms underlying sensory processing in mouse barrel cortex L1. Whisker stimuli evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by strong lateral inhibition. A mild aversive stimulus activated cholinergic inputs and evoked a bimodal distribution of spiking responses in L1. A simple conductance-based model that only contained lateral inhibition within L1 recapitulated the sensory responses and the winner-takes-all cholinergic responses, and the model correctly predicted that the network would function as a spatial and temporal high-pass filter for excitatory inputs. Our results demonstrate that all-optical electrophysiology can reveal basic principles of neural circuit function in vivo and suggest an intuitive picture for how L1 transforms sensory and modulatory inputs.

Despite the wealth of in vitro information, fundamental questions about how glutamatergic synapses are formed in the mammalian brain remain unanswered. Glutamate receptor (GluR) δ2 is essential for cerebellar synapse formation in vivo. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluRδ2 interacts with presynaptic neurexins (NRXNs) through cerebellin 1 precursor protein (Cbln1). The synaptogenic activity of GluRδ2 is abolished in cerebellar primary cultures from Cbln1 knockout mice and is restored by recombinant Cbln1. Knockdown of NRXNs in cerebellar granule cells also hinders the synaptogenic activity of GluRδ2. Both the NTD of GluRδ2 and the extracellular domain of NRXN1β suppressed the synaptogenic activity of Cbln1 in cerebellar primary cultures and in vivo. These results suggest that GluRδ2 mediates cerebellar synapse formation by interacting with presynaptic NRXNs through Cbln1. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Molneuro; Proteins,Uemura T.; Lee S.-J.; Yasumura M.; Takeuchi T.; Yoshida T.; Ra M.; Taguchi R.; Sakimura K.; Mishina M.,47.0,5045971.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2010,7,1.0617455,0.6505956,0.64604217,1.1459041,0.5123046,0.09364792532614014,0.63023424,0.44243705,0.060167102307013276,0.5102485,0.39545786,0.06115204388108669,0.5739085,0.3948021,0.062023768247117694,0.5824127,0.8855669498443604,0.44996753334999084

However, it is unknown how S-glutathionylation may regulate the elasticity of titin and cardiac tissue. Here, we show that mechanical unfolding of titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domains exposes buried cysteine residues, which then can be S-glutathionylated. S-glutathionylation of cryptic cysteines greatly decreases the mechanical stability of the parent Ig domain as well as its ability to fold. Both effects favor a more extensible state of titin.

Moreover, Regnase-1 specifically cleaves and degrades translationally active mRNAs and requires the helicase activity of UPF1, similar to the decay mechanisms of nonsense mRNAs. In contrast, Roquin controls translationally inactive mRNAs, independent of UPF1. Defects in both Regnase-1 and Roquin lead to large increases in their target mRNAs, although Regnase-1 tends to control the early phase of inflammation when mRNAs are more actively translated.

Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis.

CaMKII was identified over 20 years ago by activation dependence on Ca2+/CaM, but recent evidence shows that CaMKII activity is also enhanced by pro-oxidant conditions. Here we show that oxidation of paired regulatory domain methionine residues sustains CaMKII activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. CaMKII is activated by angiotensin II (AngII)-induced oxidation, leading to apoptosis in cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. CaMKII oxidation is reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA), and MsrA-/- mice show exaggerated CaMKII oxidation and myocardial apoptosis, impaired cardiac function, and increased mortality after myocardial infarction. Our data demonstrate a dynamic mechanism for CaMKII activation by oxidation and highlight the critical importance of oxidation-dependent CaMKII activation to AngII and ischemic myocardial apoptosis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

By sequencing the genomes, we find that these ancient plague strains are basal to all known Yersinia pestis. We find the origins of the Yersinia pestis lineage to be at least two times older than previous estimates.

We now provide a functional rationale for this long-observed sequence diversity by demonstrating that differences among signals facilitate substrate-selective modulation of protein translocation. We find that during acute ER stress, translocation of secretory and membrane proteins is rapidly and transiently attenuated in a signal sequence-selective manner. Their cotranslational rerouting to the cytosol for degradation reduces the burden of misfolded substrates entering the ER and represents a pathway for pre-emptive quality control (pQC). Bypassing the pQC pathway for the prion protein increases its rate of aggregation in the ER lumen during prolonged stress and renders cells less capable of viable recovery. Conversely, pharmacologically augmenting pQC during ER stress proved protective. Thus, protein translocation is a physiologically regulated process that is utilized for pQC as part of the ER stress response. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex serves as a repressor of the mTOR pathway, and disruption of TSC1/TSC2 complex function may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we show that IKKβ, a major downstream kinase in the TNFα signaling pathway, physically interacts with and phosphorylates TSC1 at Ser487 and Ser511, resulting in suppression of TSC1. The IKKβ-mediated TSC1 suppression activates the mTOR pathway, enhances angiogenesis, and results in tumor development. We further find that expression of activated IKKβ is associated with TSC1 Ser511 phosphorylation and VEGF production in multiple tumor types and correlates with poor clinical outcome of breast cancer patients.

PARIS represses the expression of the transcriptional coactivator, PGC-1α the PGC-1α target gene, NRF-1 by binding to insulin response sequences in the PGC-1α promoter. Conditional knockout of parkin in adult animals leads to progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in a PARIS-dependent manner. Moreover, overexpression of PARIS leads to the selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra, and this is reversed by either parkin or PGC-1α coexpression.

Developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) must therefore synchronize their dynamics with a variable timescale. We find that layered repression of genes couples GRN output with variable metabolism. When repressors of transcription or mRNA and protein stability are lost, fewer errors in Drosophila development occur when metabolism is lowered. We demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon by eliminating the entire microRNA family of repressors and find that development to maturity can be largely rescued when metabolism is reduced. Using a mathematical model that replicates GRN dynamics, we find that lowering metabolism suppresses the emergence of developmental errors by curtailing the influence of auxiliary repressors on GRN output. We experimentally show that gene expression dynamics are less affected by loss of repressors when metabolism is reduced. Thus, layered repression provides robustness through error suppression and may provide an evolutionary route to a shorter reproductive cycle. microRNAs become dispensable for development in the context of slower metabolism.",control theory; development; Drosophila; mathematical modeling; metabolism; microRNA,Cassidy J.J.; Bernasek S.M.; Bakker R.; Giri R.; Pelaez N.; Eder B.; Bobrowska A.; Bagheri N.; Nunes Amaral L.A.; Carthew R.W.,91.0,736263057.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2019,8,0.37020183,0.32524085,0.32546714,0.37379476,0.4091537,0.06804263559830959,0.6329846,0.39594984,0.04201068589855489,0.52528113,0.4294424,0.0941300683712692,0.42560107,0.34306192,0.0447118480203072,0.4538595,0.06710093468427658,-0.41682469844818115

Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial pathogen that has acquired high-level antibiotic resistance, is a common cause of pulmonary infections. Optimal clearance of K. pneumoniae from the host lung requires TNF and IL-17A. Herein, we demonstrate that inflammatory monocytes are rapidly recruited to the lungs of K. pneumoniae-infected mice and produce TNF, which markedly increases the frequency of IL-17-producing innate lymphoid cells. While pulmonary clearance of K. pneumoniae is preserved in neutrophil-depleted mice, monocyte depletion or TNF deficiency impairs IL-17A-dependent resolution of pneumonia. Monocyte-mediated bacterial uptake and killing is enhanced by ILC production of IL-17A, indicating that innate lymphocytes engage in a positive-feedback loop with monocytes that promotes clearance of pneumonia.

Myc proteins seem to regulate diverse biological processes, but their role in tumorigenesis remains enigmatic. Here we use Drosophila imaginal discs to mimic situations in which cells with unequal levels of Myc protein are apposed and show that this invariably elicits a win/lose situation reminiscent of cell competition; cells with lower levels of dMyc are eliminated by apoptosis whereas cells with higher levels of dMyc overproliferate. We find that this competitive behavior correlates with, and can be corrected by, the activation of the BMP/Dpp survival signaling pathway.

How the Xs are maintained differently in the same nucleus remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the inactive X (Xi) is targeted to a distinct nuclear compartment following pairing with its homologous partner. During mid-to-late S phase, 80%-90% of Xi contact the nucleolus and reside within a Snf2h-enriched ring. Autosomes carrying ectopic X-inactivation center sequences are also targeted to the perinucleolar compartment. Deleting Xist results in a loss of nucleolar association and an inability to maintain Xi heterochromatin, leading to Xi reactivation at the single gene level. We propose that the Xi must continuously visit the perinucleolar compartment to maintain its epigenetic state.

To address the molecular basis of this SpoIV transmembrane signaling, we carried out a structure-function analysis of the activating protease CtpB. Crystal structures reflecting distinct functional states show that CtpB constitutes a ring-like protein scaffold penetrated by two narrow tunnels. Access to the proteolytic sites sequestered within these tunnels is controlled by PDZ domains that rearrange upon substrate binding. Accordingly, CtpB resembles a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease regulated by a unique allosteric mechanism. Moreover, biochemical analysis of the PDZ-gated channel combined with sporulation assays reveal that activation of the SpoIV RIP pathway is induced by the concerted activity of CtpB and a second signaling protease, SpoIVB. This proteolytic mechanism is of broad relevance for cell-cell communication, illustrating how distinct signaling pathways can be integrated into a single RIP module. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Mastny M.; Heuck A.; Kurzbauer R.; Heiduk A.; Boisguerin P.; Volkmer R.; Ehrmann M.; Rodrigues C.D.A.; Rudner D.Z.; Clausen T.,53.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,0.579817,0.43350196,0.43111047,0.5834099,0.5143101,0.09369021568384406,0.56603384,0.5170665,0.10550037001739243,0.5724587,0.1604253,-0.014617511790843363,0.5443395,0.4391979,0.07554953164562733,0.4418985,0.5763686299324036,-0.07155698537826538

Target cells however mount a response to such membrane damage. Here we show that toxin-induced membrane permeabilization leads to a decrease in cytoplasmic potassium, which promotes the formation of a multiprotein oligomeric innate immune complex, called the inflammasome, and the activation of caspase-1. Further, we find that when rendered proteolytic in this context caspase-1 induces the activation of the central regulators of membrane biogenesis, the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs), which in turn promote cell survival upon toxin challenge possibly by facilitating membrane repair. This study highlights that, in addition to its well-established role in triggering inflammation via the processing of the precursor forms of interleukins, caspase-1 has a broader role, in particular linking the intracellular ion composition to lipid metabolic pathways, membrane biogenesis, and survival. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that, in mice, successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. We find that, whereas recent memory recall induces a limited period of hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated, in part, by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and histone acetylation, such plasticity is absent for remote memories. However, by using an HDAC2-targeting inhibitor (HDACi) during reconsolidation, even remote memories can be persistently attenuated. This intervention epigenetically primes the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes, which is accompanied by higher metabolic, synaptic, and structural plasticity. Thus, applying HDACis during memory reconsolidation might constitute a treatment option for remote traumata. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Graff J.; Joseph N.F.; Horn M.E.; Samiei A.; Meng J.; Seo J.; Rei D.; Bero A.W.; Phan T.X.; Wagner F.; Holson E.; Xu J.; Sun J.; Neve R.L.; Mach R.H.; Haggarty S.J.; Tsai L.-H.,75.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,8,0.7420972,0.61393917,0.6004369,0.72614926,0.45464087,0.05784490300579648,0.43727425,0.45398724,0.07550341902868024,0.65823644,0.2540064,0.05670317168338379,0.54322565,0.23626041,0.04067323266803602,0.35051244,0.3877292573451996,-0.24825988709926605

Here, we show that the Drosophila mushroom body functions like a switchboard in which neuromodulation reroutes the same odor signal to different behavioral circuits, depending on the state and experience of the fly. Using functional synaptic imaging and electrophysiology, we reveal that dopaminergic inputs to the mushroom body modulate synaptic transmission with exquisite spatial specificity, allowing individual neurons to differentially convey olfactory signals to each of their postsynaptic targets. Moreover, we show that the dopaminergic neurons function as an interconnected network, encoding information about both an animal's external context and internal state to coordinate synaptic plasticity throughout the mushroom body.

Paradoxically, many cell types coexpress both ligands and receptors, raising the question of how specific signaling readouts are achieved under these conditions. Here, we studied the signaling activities exerted by coexpressed EphA receptors and GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands in spinal motor neuron growth cones. We demonstrate that coexpressed Eph and ephrin proteins segregate laterally into distinct membrane domains from which they signal opposing effects on the growth cone: EphAs direct growth cone collapse/repulsion and ephrin-As signal motor axon growth/attraction. This subcellular arrangement of Eph-ephrin proteins enables axons to discriminate between cis- versus trans-configurations of ligand/receptor proteins, thereby allowing the utilization of both Ephs and ephrins as functional guidance receptors within the same neuronal growth cone.

SLPI and PEPI form complexes, preventing elastase from converting PEPI to EPIs. Supplying PEPI corrects the wound-healing defect in SLPI null mice.

Extracellular RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and other cellular proteins are differentially expressed in exosomes and non-vesicle compartments. Argonaute 1–4, glycolytic enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins were not detected in exosomes.

Instead, we propose a new model for active secretion of extracellular DNA through an autophagy- and multivesicular-endosome-dependent but exosome-independent mechanism. This study demonstrates the need for a reassessment of exosome composition and offers a framework for a clearer understanding of extracellular vesicle heterogeneity.

Affinity-chromatography experiments revealed that the lysosomal integral membrane protein LIMP-2 is a specific binding partner of β-glucocerebrosidase. This interaction involves a coiled-coil domain within the lumenal domain. β-glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels were severely decreased in LIMP-2-deficient mouse tissues. Analysis of fibroblasts and macrophages isolated from these mice indicated that the majority of β-glucocerebrosidase was secreted. Missorting of β-glucocerebrosidase was also evident in vivo, as protein and activity levels were significantly higher in sera from LIMP-2-deficient mice compared to wild-type.

This genome-wide search identified two proteins, Bqt1 and Bqt2, that connect telomeres to the spindle-pole body (SPB; the centrosome equivalent in fungi). Neither Bqt1 nor Bqt2 alone functions as a connector, but together the two proteins form a bridge between Rap1 (a telomere protein) and Sad1 (an SPB protein). Significantly, when both Bqt1 and Bqt2 are ectopically expressed in mitotic cells, they also form a bridge between Rap1 and Sad1.

Here, we report the discovery of signaling components involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) response of immune dendritic cells (DCs), including a previously unkown pathway shared across mammalian antiviral responses. By combining transcriptional profiling, genetic and small-molecule perturbations, and phosphoproteomics, we uncover 35 signaling regulators, including 16 known regulators, involved in TLR signaling. In particular, we find that Polo-like kinases (Plk) 2 and 4 are essential components of antiviral pathways in vitro and in vivo and activate a signaling branch involving a dozen proteins, among which is Tnfaip2, a gene associated with autoimmune diseases but whose role was unknown.

We have previously shown that RIG-I binds to unanchored lysine-63 (K63) polyubiquitin chains and that this binding is important for MAVS activation; however, the mechanism underlying MAVS activation is not understood. Here, we show that viral infection induces the formation of very large MAVS aggregates, which potently activate IRF3 in the cytosol. We find that a fraction of recombinant MAVS protein forms fibrils that are capable of activating IRF3. Remarkably, the MAVS fibrils behave like prions and effectively convert endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. We also show that, in the presence of K63 ubiquitin chains, RIG-I catalyzes the conversion of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane to prion-like aggregates.

Receptor binding and HTLV envelope-driven infection are selectively inhibited when glucose transport or GLUT-1 expression are blocked by cytochalasin B or siRNAs, respectively. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLUT-1, but not the related transporter GLUT-3, restores HTLV infection abrogated by either GLUT-1 siRNAs or interfering HTLV envelope glycoproteins.

As for any biological amplification system, we expect an underlying architecture that will limit the ability of a randomly encountered trigger to produce an uncontrolled and self-escalating response. Investigating such limits in Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that feed-forward amplification is limited by biosynthetic and structural distinctions at the RNA level between (1) triggers that can produce amplification and (2) siRNA products of the amplification reaction.

The use of isogenic tumor cell lines expressing either wild-type mTOR cDNA or a mutant that does not bind RAD001 demonstrates that the effects of RAD001 are through inhibition of mTOR function. We further show that RAD001 sensitizes cells to cisplatin by inhibiting p53-induced p21 expression.

However, guide RNA libraries are costly to synthesize, and their limited diversity compromises the sensitivity of CRISPR screens. Using the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery, we developed CRISPR adaptation-mediated library manufacturing (CALM), which turns bacterial cells into “factories” for generating hundreds of thousands of crRNAs covering 95% of all targetable genomic sites. With an average gene targeted by more than 100 distinct crRNAs, these highly comprehensive CRISPRi libraries produced varying degrees of transcriptional repression critical for uncovering novel antibiotic resistance determinants. Furthermore, by iterating CRISPR adaptation, we rapidly generated dual-crRNA libraries representing more than 100,000 dual-gene perturbations. The polarized nature of spacer adaptation revealed the historical contingency in the stepwise acquisition of genetic perturbations leading to increasing antibiotic resistance.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, but its causes are debated. We show that, during aging, there is a specific loss of mitochondrial, but not nuclear, encoded OXPHOS subunits. We trace the cause to an alternate PGC-1α/β-independent pathway of nuclear-mitochondrial communication that is induced by a decline in nuclear NAD+ and the accumulation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, with parallels to Warburg reprogramming. Deleting SIRT1 accelerates this process, whereas raising NAD+ levels in old mice restores mitochondrial function to that of a young mouse in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Thus, a pseudohypoxic state that disrupts PGC-1α/β-independent nuclear-mitochondrial communication contributes to the decline in mitochondrial function with age, a process that is apparently reversible. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Gomes A.P.; Price N.L.; Ling A.J.Y.; Moslehi J.J.; Montgomery M.K.; Rajman L.; White J.P.; Teodoro J.S.; Wrann C.D.; Hubbard B.P.; Mercken E.M.; Palmeira C.M.; De Cabo R.; Rolo A.P.; Turner N.; Bell E.L.; Sinclair D.A.,67.0,718215511.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2013,7,1.3988352,0.7558048,0.73659444,1.3534387,0.39165807,0.061422489989249485,0.48967302,0.48648632,0.09350603289698317,0.6326854,0.35119176,0.08457776501522735,0.49811485,0.42530024,0.10454706886089848,0.6544759,0.5806422233581543,0.29939591884613037

The crystal structure of a SelO homolog reveals a protein kinase-like fold with ATP flipped in the active site, thus providing a structural basis for catalysis. SelO pseudokinases localize to the mitochondria and AMPylate proteins involved in redox homeostasis. Consequently, SelO activity is necessary for the proper cellular response to oxidative stress. Our results suggest that AMPylation may be a more widespread post-translational modification than previously appreciated and that pseudokinases should be analyzed for alternative transferase activities.

The 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of a closed trimer of the clathrin adaptor AP-1, the small GTPase Arf1, HIV-1 Nef, and the cytosolic tail of the restriction factor tetherin suggested a mechanism for inactivating tetherin by Golgi retention. The 4.3 Å structure of a mutant Nef-induced dimer of AP-1 showed how the closed trimer is regulated by the dileucine loop of Nef. HDX-MS and mutational analysis were used to show how cargo dynamics leads to alternative Arf1 trimerization, directing Nef targets to be either retained at the trans-Golgi or sorted to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of the NL4-3 M-Nef was shown to regulate AP-1 trimerization, explaining how O-Nefs lacking this phosphosite counteract tetherin but most M-Nefs do not.

This requires Schwann cells to migrate collectively to guide regrowing axons across a 'bridge' of new tissue, which forms to reconnect a severed nerve. Here we show that blood vessels direct the migrating cords of Schwann cells. This multicellular process is initiated by hypoxia, selectively sensed by macrophages within the bridge, which via VEGF-A secretion induce a polarized vasculature that relieves the hypoxia. Schwann cells then use the blood vessels as ""tracks"" to cross the bridge taking regrowing axons with them. Importantly, disrupting the organization of the newly formed blood vessels in vivo, either by inhibiting the angiogenic signal or by re-orienting them, compromises Schwann cell directionality resulting in defective nerve repair.

How this sophisticated perception system can be usefully deployed in roots, continuously exposed to microbes, remains a mystery. By analyzing MAMP receptor expression and response at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis, we observed that differentiated outer cell layers show low expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and lack MAMP responsiveness. Yet, these cells can be gated to become responsive by neighbor cell damage. Laser ablation of small cell clusters strongly upregulates PRR expression in their vicinity, and elevated receptor expression is sufficient to induce responsiveness in non-responsive cells. Finally, localized damage also leads to immune responses to otherwise non-immunogenic, beneficial bacteria. Damage-gating is overridden by receptor overexpression, which antagonizes colonization. Our findings that cellular damage can “switch on” local immune responses helps to conceptualize how MAMP perception can be used despite the presence of microbial patterns in the soil. © 2020 The Author(s)Roots require both microbial molecular patterns and plant tissue damage in order to mount localized antibacterial immune responses, revealing an effective way to respond appropriately to pathogens while sparing commensals.",Arabidopsis; damage-gating; localized response; microbe patterns; pattern-recognition receptors; root immunity,Zhou F.; Emonet A.; Denervaud Tendon V.; Marhavy P.; Wu D.; Lahaye T.; Geldner N.,77.0,737323906.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2020,8,0.6097798,0.4463889,0.45711237,0.5292656,0.46466672,0.052115545354803394,0.65107924,0.4269452,0.06857596638236063,0.44888604,0.42162704,0.07903207457741745,0.60457075,0.4173262,0.0931080599163639,0.6229518,-0.038708850741386414,0.3141634166240692

Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions.

Mice homozygous for the loxTB Mc4r allele do not express MC4Rs and are markedly obese. Restoration of MC4R expression in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) and a subpopulation of amygdala neurons, using Sim1-Cre transgenic mice, prevented 60% of the obesity. Of note, increased food intake, typical of Mc4r null mice, was completely rescued while reduced energy expenditure was unaffected. These findings demonstrate that MC4Rs in the PVH and/or the amygdala control food intake but that MC4Rs elsewhere control energy expenditure.

Transport requires interaction between Scap's two ER luminal loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap's binding to Insig, an ER retention protein. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol. Strikingly, L1 and L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap.

First, 43S preinitiation complexes comprising 40S ribosomal subunits, eIFs 3, 2, 1, and 1A, and tRNAMeti attach to the 5′-proximal region of mRNA and then scan along the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) to the initiation codon. Attachment of 43S complexes is mediated by three other eIFs, 4F, 4A, and 4B, which cooperatively unwind the cap-proximal region of mRNA and later also assist 43S complexes during scanning.

The mechanisms whereby chromatin structure and cell cycle progression are restored after DNA repair are largely unknown. We show that chromatin reassembly following double-strand break (DSB) repair requires the histone chaperone Asf1 and that absence of Asf1 causes cell death, as cells are unable to recover from the DNA damage checkpoint. We find that Asf1 contributes toward chromatin assembly after DSB repair by promoting acetylation of free histone H3 on lysine 56 (K56) via the histone acetyl transferase Rtt109. Mimicking acetylation of K56 bypasses the requirement for Asf1 for chromatin reassembly and checkpoint recovery, whereas mutations that prevent K56 acetylation block chromatin reassembly after repair. These results indicate that restoration of the chromatin following DSB repair is driven by acetylated H3 K56 and that this is a signal for the completion of repair. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of this mechanism on the proteome and whether it is positively exploited in normal organismal responses remain unclear. We found that the plant photoreceptor phytochrome induces genome-wide changes in alternative promoter selection in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through this mechanism, protein isoforms with different N termini are produced that display light-dependent differences in localization. For instance, shade-grown plants accumulate a cytoplasmic isoform of glycerate kinase (GLYK), an essential photorespiration enzyme that was previously thought to localize exclusively to the chloroplast. Cytoplasmic GLYK constitutes a photorespiratory bypass that alleviates fluctuating light-induced photoinhibition. Therefore, phytochrome controls alternative promoter selection to modulate protein localization in response to changing light conditions. This study suggests that alternative promoter usage represents another ubiquitous layer of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes that contributes to diversification of the proteome.

In addition, cohesins appear to regulate gene expression and enhancer-promoter interactions.

We show that the distribution of cohesins on mammalian chromosome arms is not driven by transcriptional activity, in contrast to S. cerevisiae. Instead, mammalian cohesins occupy a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites, many of which contain sequence motifs resembling the consensus for CTCF, a DNA-binding protein with enhancer blocking function and boundary-element activity. We find cohesins at most CTCF sites and show that CTCF is required for cohesin localization to these sites. Recruitment by CTCF suggests a rationale for noncanonical cohesin functions and, because CTCF binding is sensitive to DNA methylation, allows cohesin positioning to integrate DNA sequence and epigenetic state. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Surprisingly, CMG undergoes rapid diffusion on dsDNA and can transition back onto ssDNA to nucleate a functional replisome.

Upon metabolic stress, AMPK suppresses anabolic and promotes catabolic processes to regain energy homeostasis. Cancer cells can occasionally suppress the growth-restrictive AMPK pathway by mutation of an upstream regulatory kinase. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism to suppress AMPK through its ubiquitination and degradation by the cancer-specific MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A6 are highly similar proteins normally expressed only in the male germline but frequently re-activated in human cancers. MAGE-A3/6 are necessary for cancer cell viability and are sufficient to drive tumorigenic properties of non-cancerous cells. Screening for targets of MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 revealed that it ubiquitinates and degrades AMPKα1.

We show that pentose-phosphate-pathway generation of NADPH is critical for oocyte survival and that the target of this regulation is caspase-2, previously shown to be required for oocyte death in mice. Pentose-phosphate-pathway-mediated inhibition of cell death was due to the inhibitory phosphorylation of caspase-2 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).

The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes possess discrete compartments that are characterized by differing transcriptional activities. Contrastingly, most bacterial chromosomes have simpler organization with local domains, the boundaries of which are influenced by gene expression. Numerous studies have revealed that the higher-order architectures of bacterial and eukaryotic chromosomes are dependent on the actions of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily protein complexes, in particular, the near-universal condensin complex. Intriguingly, however, many archaea, including members of the genus Sulfolobus do not encode canonical condensin. We describe chromosome conformation capture experiments on Sulfolobus species. These reveal the presence of distinct domains along Sulfolobus chromosomes that undergo discrete and specific higher-order interactions, thus defining two compartment types.

We have identified a subsequent agonist-induced phosphorylation that plays a central dual role in Smad transcriptional activation and turnover. As receptor-activated Smads form transcriptional complexes, they are phosphorylated at an interdomain linker region by CDK8 and CDK9, which are components of transcriptional mediator and elongation complexes. These phosphorylations promote Smad transcriptional action, which in the case of Smad1 is mediated by the recruitment of YAP to the phosphorylated linker sites. An effector of the highly conserved Hippo organ size control pathway, YAP supports Smad1-dependent transcription and is required for BMP suppression of neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. The phosphorylated linker is ultimately recognized by specific ubiquitin ligases, leading to proteasome-mediated turnover of activated Smad proteins.

PcG-mediated repression is conserved in metazoans and is targeted in Drosophila by Polycomb response elements (PREs). However, targeting sequences in humans have not been described. While analyzing chromatin architecture in the context of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, we discovered a 1.8kb region between HOXD11 and HOXD12 (D11.12) that is associated with PcG proteins, becomes nuclease hypersensitive, and then shows alteration in nuclease sensitivity as hESCs differentiate. The D11.12 element repressed luciferase expression from a reporter construct and full repression required a highly conserved region and YY1 binding sites. Furthermore, repression was dependent on the PcG proteins BMI1 and EED and a YY1-interacting partner, RYBP. We conclude that D11.12 is a Polycomb-dependent regulatory region with similarities to Drosophila PREs, indicating conservation in the mechanisms that target PcG function in mammals and flies. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here we identify gene model 98, which we have named myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), as a transcriptional regulator required for CNS myelination. Within the CNS, MRF is specifically expressed by postmitotic oligodendrocytes. MRF is a nuclear protein containing an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain homologous to a yeast transcription factor. Knockdown of MRF in oligodendrocytes by RNA interference prevents expression of most CNS myelin genes; conversely, overexpression of MRF within cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors or the chick spinal cord promotes expression of myelin genes. In mice lacking MRF within the oligodendrocyte lineage, premyelinating oligodendrocytes are generated but display severe deficits in myelin gene expression and fail to myelinate. These mice display severe neurological abnormalities and die because of seizures during the third postnatal week.

Here, we report that current influenza vaccines poorly display key NA epitopes and rarely induce NA-reactive B cells. Conversely, influenza virus infection induces NA-reactive B cells at a frequency that approaches (H1N1) or exceeds (H3N2) that of HA-reactive B cells. NA-reactive antibodies display broad binding activity spanning the entire history of influenza A virus circulation in humans, including the original pandemic strains of both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The antibodies robustly inhibit the enzymatic activity of NA, including oseltamivir-resistant variants, and provide robust prophylactic protection, including against avian H5N1 viruses, in vivo. When used therapeutically, NA-reactive antibodies protected mice from lethal influenza virus challenge even 48 hr post infection. These findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccines should be optimized to improve targeting of NA for durable and broad protection against divergent influenza strains.

We conducted a histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) by performing H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 257 postmortem samples from ASD and matched control brains. Despite etiological heterogeneity, ≥68% of syndromic and idiopathic ASD cases shared a common acetylome signature at >5,000 cis-regulatory elements in prefrontal and temporal cortex. Similarly, multiple genes associated with rare genetic mutations in ASD showed common “epimutations.” Acetylome aberrations in ASD were not attributable to genetic differentiation at cis-SNPs and highlighted genes involved in synaptic transmission, ion transport, epilepsy, behavioral abnormality, chemokinesis, histone deacetylation, and immunity. By correlating histone acetylation with genotype, we discovered >2,000 histone acetylation quantitative trait loci (haQTLs) in human brain regions, including four candidate causal variants for psychiatric diseases. Due to the relative stability of histone modifications postmortem, we anticipate that the HAWAS approach will be applicable to multiple diseases.",autism spectrum disorder; disease-epigenetic alterations; epigenetics; histone acetylation; histone acetylation quantitative trait loci; regulome profiling,Sun W.; Poschmann J.; Cruz-Herrera del Rosario R.; Parikshak N.N.; Hajan H.S.; Kumar V.; Ramasamy R.; Belgard T.G.; Elanggovan B.; Wong C.C.Y.; Mill J.; Geschwind D.H.; Prabhakar S.,79.0,726984205.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.5347778,0.5100262,0.5228099,0.53126204,0.32778883,0.05224803569297881,0.5790587,0.471444,0.07642531681556358,0.4276596,0.2887144,0.07622336116876471,0.42137042,0.422413,0.0843456509213405,0.5504454,0.2527059018611908,-0.036720409989356995

The transcriptional regulator Aire has been thought to be sufficient for the induction of TRAs, despite some indications that other factors may promote TRA expression in the thymus. Here, we show that the transcription factor Fezf2 directly regulates various TRA genes in mTECs independently of Aire. Mice lacking Fezf2 in mTECs displayed severe autoimmune symptoms, including the production of autoantibodies and inflammatory cell infiltration targeted to peripheral organs. These responses differed from those detected in Aire-deficient mice. Furthermore, Fezf2 expression and Aire expression are regulated by distinct signaling pathways and promote the expression of different classes of proteins.

We show here that R-2HG also exerts a broad anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation/viability and by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, R-2HG inhibits fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) activity, thereby increasing global N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in R-2HG-sensitive leukemia cells, which in turn decreases the stability of MYC/CEBPA transcripts, leading to the suppression of relevant pathways. Ectopically expressed mutant IDH1 and S-2HG recapitulate the effects of R-2HG. High levels of FTO sensitize leukemic cells to R-2HG, whereas hyperactivation of MYC signaling confers resistance that can be reversed by the inhibition of MYC signaling. R-2HG also displays anti-tumor activity in glioma. Collectively, while R-2HG accumulated in IDH1/2 mutant cancers contributes to cancer initiation, our work demonstrates anti-tumor effects of 2HG in inhibiting proliferation/survival of FTO-high cancer cells via targeting FTO/m6A/MYC/CEBPA signaling.

In yeast, span extension from dietary restriction is thought to be mediated by the highly conserved, nutrient-responsive target of rapamycin (TOR), protein kinase A (PKA), and Sch9 kinases. These kinases coordinately regulate various cellular processes including stress responses, protein turnover, cell growth, and ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that a specific reduction of 60S ribosomal subunit levels slows aging in yeast. Deletion of genes encoding 60S subunit proteins or processing factors or treatment with a small molecule, which all inhibit 60S subunit biogenesis, are each sufficient to significantly increase replicative life span. One mechanism by which reduced 60S subunit levels leads to life span extension is through induction of Gcn4, a nutrient-responsive transcription factor. Genetic epistasis analyses suggest that dietary restriction, reduced 60S subunit abundance, and Gcn4 activation extend yeast life span by similar mechanisms. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, targeting of liver cells by adenoviruses compromises their potential efficacy. In cell culture, the adenovirus serotype 5 fiber protein engages the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) to bind cells. Paradoxically, following intravascular delivery, CAR is not used for liver transduction, implicating alternate pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that coagulation factor (F)X directly binds adenovirus leading to liver infection. Here, we show that FX binds to the Ad5 hexon, not fiber, via an interaction between the FX Gla domain and hypervariable regions of the hexon surface. Binding occurs in multiple human adenovirus serotypes. Liver infection by the FX-Ad5 complex is mediated through a heparin-binding exosite in the FX serine protease domain.

To investigate how cortical dynein interacts with microtubule ends to generate force and how this functional association impacts positioning, we have reconstituted the 'cortical' interaction between dynein and dynamic microtubule ends in an in vitro system using microfabricated barriers. We show that barrier-attached dynein captures microtubule ends, inhibits growth, and triggers microtubule catastrophes, thereby controlling microtubule length. The subsequent interaction with shrinking microtubule ends generates pulling forces up to several pN. By combining experiments in microchambers with a theoretical description of aster mechanics, we show that dynein-mediated pulling forces lead to the reliable centering of microtubule asters in simple confining geometries.

Here, we show, using budding yeast, that dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates involved in sequential mitotic exit events occurs with ordered timing. We test different models of how ordering might be achieved by modulating Cdk and Cdk-counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 activities in vivo, as well as by kinetic analysis of Cdk substrate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in vitro. Our results suggest that the gradual change of the phosphatase to kinase ratio over the course of mitotic exit is read out by Cdk substrates that respond by dephosphorylation at distinct thresholds.

It has been postulated that parallel circuitry embedded within hippocampal subfields may underlie such functional diversity. We sought to identify, delineate, and manipulate this putatively parallel architecture in the dorsal subiculum, the primary output subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Population and single-cell RNA-seq revealed that the subiculum can be divided into two spatially adjacent subregions associated with prominent differences in pyramidal cell gene expression. Pyramidal cells occupying these two regions differed in their long-range inputs, local wiring, projection targets, and electrophysiological properties.

NFAT forms cooperative complexes with the AP-1 family of transcription factors and regulates T cell activation-associated genes. Here we show that regulatory T cell (Treg) function is mediated by an analogous cooperative complex of NFAT with the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3, a lineage specification factor for Tregs. The crystal structure of an NFAT:FOXP2:DNA complex reveals an extensive protein-protein interaction interface between NFAT and FOXP2. Structure-guided mutations of FOXP3, predicted to progressively disrupt its interaction with NFAT, interfere in a graded manner with the ability of FOXP3 to repress expression of the cytokine IL2, upregulate expression of the Treg markers CTLA4 and CD25, and confer suppressor function in a murine model of autoimmune diabetes. Thus by switching transcriptional partners, NFAT converts the acute T cell activation program into the suppressor program of Tregs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A key step that is disrupted in these patients is nuclear import of FUS mediated by the import receptor Transportin/Karyopherin-β2. In ALS-FUS patients, this is caused by mutations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of FUS that weaken Transportin binding. In FTD-FUS patients, Transportin is aggregated, and post-translational arginine methylation, which regulates the FUS-Transportin interaction, is lost. Here, we show that Transportin and arginine methylation have a crucial function beyond nuclear import—namely to suppress RGG/RG-driven phase separation and stress granule association of FUS. ALS-associated FUS-NLS mutations weaken the chaperone activity of Transportin and loss of FUS arginine methylation, as seen in FTD-FUS, promote phase separation, and stress granule partitioning of FUS. Our findings reveal two regulatory mechanisms of liquid-phase homeostasis that are disrupted in FUS-associated neurodegeneration.

Importantly, deletion of circadian clock components did not reproduce the hallmarks of this reprogramming, underscoring that rewiring, rather than arrhythmia, is associated with physiological aging. While age-associated rewiring of the oscillatory diurnal transcriptome is not recapitulated by a high-fat diet in young adult mice, it is significantly prevented by long-term caloric restriction in aged mice.

We show that arrested RNAPII elongation complexes are the preferred substrates for ubiquitylation. Accordingly, not only DNA-damage-dependent but also DNA-damage-independent transcriptional arrest results in RNAPII ubiquitylation in vivo. Def1, known to be required for damage-induced degradation of RNAPII, stimulates ubiquitylation of RNAPII only in an elongation complex. Ubiquitylation of RNAPII is dependent on its C-terminal repeat domain (CTD). Moreover, CTD phosphorylation at serine 5, a hallmark of the initiating polymerase, but not at serine 2, a hallmark of the elongating polymerase, completely inhibits ubiquitylation. In agreement with this, ubiquitylated RNAPII is hypophosphorylated at serine 5 in vivo, and mutation of the serine 5 phosphatase SSU72 inhibits RNAPII degradation. These results identify several mechanisms that confine ubiquitylation of RNAPII to the forms of the enzyme that arrest during elongation.

We report that the full complement of cardiomyocytes is established perinataly and remains stable over the human lifespan, whereas the numbers of both endothelial and mesenchymal cells increase substantially from birth to early adulthood. Analysis of the integration of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C revealed a high turnover rate of endothelial cells throughout life (>15% per year) and more limited renewal of mesenchymal cells (<4% per year in adulthood). Cardiomyocyte exchange is highest in early childhood and decreases gradually throughout life to <1% per year in adulthood, with similar turnover rates in the major subdivisions of the myocardium.

Human let-7 miRNA inhibits translation initiation of mRNA targets in an m7G cap-dependent manner and also appears to block protein production, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved is unknown and the role of Ago proteins in translational regulation remains elusive. Here we identify a motif (MC) within the Mid domain of Ago proteins, which bears significant similarity to the m7G cap-binding domain of eIF4E, an essential translation initiation factor. We identify conserved aromatic residues within the MC motif of human Ago2 that are required for binding to the m7G cap and for translational repression but do not affect the assembly of Ago2 with miRNA or its catalytic activity. We propose that Ago2 represses the initiation of mRNA translation by binding to the m7G cap of mRNA targets, thus likely precluding the recruitment of eIF4E. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We report that kynurenic acid, a metabolite in this pathway, functions as a regulator of food-dependent behavioral plasticity in C elegans. The experience of fasting in C elegans alters a variety of behaviors, including feeding rate, when food is encountered post-fast. Levels of neurally produced kynurenic acid are depleted by fasting, leading to activation of NMDA-receptor-expressing interneurons and initiation of a neuropeptide-y-like signaling axis that promotes elevated feeding through enhanced serotonin release when animals re-encounter food. Upon refeeding, kynurenic acid levels are eventually replenished, ending the elevated feeding period. Because tryptophan is an essential amino acid, these findings suggest that a physiological role of kynurenic acid is in directly linking metabolism to activity of NMDA and serotonergic circuits, which regulate a broad range of behaviors and physiologies.",,Lemieux G.A.; Cunningham K.A.; Lin L.; Mayer F.; Werb Z.; Ashrafi K.,60.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.51821196,0.42055073,0.41086936,0.52180487,0.4227488,0.06693189492155094,0.57354444,0.47427464,0.0745397075297779,0.6249373,0.420941,0.08562139407162772,0.5345936,0.40411472,0.07485632974031337,0.6055806,0.16974763572216034,0.20910769701004028

But the origin of such ubiquitous phenomenon has not been understood. Here, we present the mechanism in bacteria. We developed a high-throughput, in vitro, single-molecule assay to follow transcription on individual DNA templates in real time. We showed that positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment by transcription slows down transcription elongation and eventually stops transcription initiation. Transcription can be resumed upon gyrase binding to the DNA segment. Furthermore, using single-cell mRNA counting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that duty cycles of transcriptional bursting depend on the intracellular gyrase concentration. Together, these findings prove that transcriptional bursting of highly expressed genes in bacteria is primarily caused by reversible gyrase dissociation from and rebinding to a DNA segment, changing the supercoiling level of the segment. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Chong S.; Chen C.; Ge H.; Xie X.S.,98.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,8,0.7420972,0.46330312,0.5198256,0.83076006,0.41910136,0.054995896654669585,0.53738713,0.4763348,0.08348403966370282,0.5251548,0.512507,0.10267950455900893,0.51850116,0.4446559,0.1035121062373639,0.63071,-0.09375598281621933,0.15050329267978668

However, the principles by which this deep brain structure encodes social information is poorly understood. We used a miniature microscope to image the Ca2+ dynamics of large neural ensembles in awake behaving mice and tracked the responses of MeA neurons over several months. These recordings revealed spatially intermingled subsets of MeA neurons with distinct temporal dynamics. The encoding of social information in the MeA differed between males and females and relied on information from both individual cells and neuronal populations. By performing long-term Ca2+ imaging across different social contexts, we found that sexual experience triggers lasting and sex-specific changes in MeA activity, which, in males, involve signaling by oxytocin.

TOR, via PKA, negatively regulates YAK1 and maintains CRF1 in the cytoplasm. Upon TOR inactivation, activated YAK1 phosphorylates and activates CRF1.

We discovered that the transmembrane domain of tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor that promotes neuronal plasticity and antidepressant responses, has a cholesterol-sensing function that mediates synaptic effects of cholesterol. We then found that both typical and fast-acting antidepressants directly bind to TRKB, thereby facilitating synaptic localization of TRKB and its activation by BDNF. Extensive computational approaches including atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealed a binding site at the transmembrane region of TRKB dimers. Mutation of the TRKB antidepressant-binding motif impaired cellular, behavioral, and plasticity-promoting responses to antidepressants in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that binding to TRKB and allosteric facilitation of BDNF signaling is the common mechanism for antidepressant action, which may explain why typical antidepressants act slowly and how molecular effects of antidepressants are translated into clinical mood recovery. Direct binding of both typical and fast-acting antidepressants to the BDNF receptor TRKB accounts for cell biological and behavioral actions of antidepressants.

However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis.

Yet how such a program is unlocked after injury remains largely unexplored. We found that axon injury in peripheral sensory neurons elicits a back-propagating calcium wave that invades the soma and causes nuclear export of HDAC5 in a PKCμ-dependent manner. Injury-induced HDAC5 nuclear export enhances histone acetylation to activate a proregenerative gene-expression program. HDAC5 nuclear export is required for axon regeneration, as expression of a nuclear-trapped HDAC5 mutant prevents axon regeneration, whereas enhancing HDAC5 nuclear export promotes axon regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Components of this HDAC5 pathway failed to be activated in a model of central nervous system injury.

To understand how antibodies can overcome the barriers imposed by the glycan shield, we crystallized fully glycosylated Env trimers from clades A, B, and G, visualizing the shield at 3.4-3.7 Å resolution. These structures reveal the HIV-1-glycan shield to comprise a network of interlocking oligosaccharides, substantially ordered by glycan crowding, that encase the protein component of Env and enable HIV-1 to avoid most antibody-mediated neutralization. The revealed features delineate a taxonomy of N-linked glycan-glycan interactions. Crowded and dispersed glycans are differently ordered, conserved, processed, and recognized by antibody. The structures, along with glycan-array binding and molecular dynamics, reveal a diversity in oligosaccharide affinity and a requirement for accommodating glycans among known broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan-shielded trimer.",,Stewart-Jones G.B.E.; Soto C.; Lemmin T.; Chuang G.-Y.; Druz A.; Kong R.; Thomas P.V.; Wagh K.; Zhou T.; Behrens A.-J.; Bylund T.; Choi C.W.; Davison J.R.; Georgiev I.S.; Joyce M.G.; Kwon Y.D.; Pancera M.; Taft J.; Yang Y.; Zhang B.; Shivatare S.S.; Shivatare V.S.; Lee C.-C.D.; Wu C.-Y.; Bewley C.A.; Burton D.R.; Koff W.C.; Connors M.; Crispin M.; Baxa U.; Korber B.T.; Wong C.-H.; Mascola J.R.; Kwong P.D.,50.0,726313943.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.62510574,0.4536262,0.5132121,0.6037668,0.41222775,0.07370522182835337,0.5362655,0.39180243,0.062112804767029295,0.4355443,0.42008734,0.08157134785997011,0.51574314,0.41956842,0.10028065049832352,0.33987406,0.2781536281108856,-0.2820642590522766

Its efficient induction requires direct engagement of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. For this purpose, we developed a bone marrow-avid nanobiologic platform designed specifically to induce trained immunity. We established the potent anti-tumor capabilities of our lead candidate MTP10-HDL in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. These anti-tumor effects result from trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis caused by epigenetic rewiring of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow, which overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MTP10-HDL nanotherapy potentiates checkpoint inhibition in this melanoma model refractory to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Finally, we determined MTP10-HDL's favorable biodistribution and safety profile in non-human primates.

These actin-regulatory endosomal components are absent from NT3/TrkA endosomes, explaining the failure of NT3 to support retrograde TrkA transport and survival. The inability of NT3 to activate Rac1-GTP-cofilin signaling is likely due to the labile nature of NT3/TrkA complexes within the acidic environment of TrkA early endosomes.

Surprisingly, Upf1 recruitment and subsequent RNA decay can be antagonized by retroviral RNA elements that promote translational readthrough. By modulating the efficiency of translation termination, recognition of long 3′UTRs by Upf1 is uncoupled from the initiation of decay. We propose a model for 3′UTR length surveillance in which equilibrium binding of Upf1 to mRNAs precedes a kinetically distinct commitment to RNA decay. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,Hogg J.R.; Goff S.P.,60.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2010,8,1.1569427,0.56552625,0.52392906,1.1113428,0.4017756,0.07357270127751692,0.5513159,0.47470498,0.05585898720858673,0.41828272,0.4167713,0.09759926901923532,0.5440771,0.43285167,0.10129329825651351,0.44256896,0.4452328681945801,-0.052120521664619446

The underlying electrical circuit, as well as the existence and role of submyelin conduction in saltatory conduction remain, however, elusive. Here, we made patch-clamp and high-speed voltage-calibrated optical recordings of potentials across the nodal and internodal axolemma of myelinated neocortical pyramidal axons combined with electron microscopy and experimentally constrained cable modeling. Our results reveal a nanoscale yet conductive periaxonal space, incompletely sealed at the paranodes, which separates the potentials across the low-capacitance myelin sheath and internodal axolemma.

How these regions and their interactions with brain-wide activity drive action selection is less understood. We have investigated this question by combining whole-brain volumetric calcium imaging using light-field microscopy and an operant-conditioning task in larval zebrafish. We find global, recurring dynamics of brain states to exhibit pre-motor bifurcations toward mutually exclusive decision outcomes. These dynamics arise from a distributed network displaying trial-by-trial functional connectivity changes, especially between cerebellum and habenula, which correlate with decision outcome. Within this network the cerebellum shows particularly strong and predictive pre-motor activity (>10 s before movement initiation), mainly within the granule cells. Turn directions are determined by the difference neuroactivity between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, while the rate of bi-hemispheric population ramping quantitatively predicts decision time on the trial-by-trial level. Our results highlight a cognitive role of the cerebellum and its importance in motor planning. A specific motor decision and its timing can be predicted using information from the cerebellum >10 s before movement, during a cognitive task in larval zebrafish.

In prokaryotes, overlapping sets of chaperones mediate both processes. In contrast, we find that eukaryotes evolved distinct chaperone networks to carry out these functions.

These stress-repressed chaperones are transcriptionally, functionally, and physically linked to the translational apparatus and associate with nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. Consistent with a function in de novo protein folding, impairment of the translation-linked chaperone network renders cells sensitive to misfolding in the context of protein synthesis but not in the context of environmental stress.

Here, we show that heme triggers the degradation of Bach1, a pro-metastatic transcription factor, by promoting its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Fbxo22. Nrf2 accumulation in lung cancers causes the stabilization of Bach1 by inducing Ho1, the enzyme catabolizing heme. In mouse models of lung cancers, loss of Keap1 or Fbxo22 induces metastasis in a Bach1-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Ho1 suppresses metastasis in a Fbxo22-dependent manner. Human metastatic lung cancer display high levels of Ho1 and Bach1. Bach1 transcriptional signature is associated with poor survival and metastasis in lung cancer patients.

We report that chronic stress exposure in rodents produces abnormal evaluation of costs and benefits resembling non-optimal decision-making in which choices of high-cost/high-reward options are sharply increased. Concomitantly, alterations in the task-related spike activity of medial prefrontal neurons correspond with increased activity of their striosome-predominant striatal projection neuron targets and with decreased and delayed striatal fast-firing interneuron activity. These effects of chronic stress on prefronto-striatal circuit dynamics could be blocked or be mimicked by selective optogenetic manipulation of these circuits.

This approach often assumes that an interface-disrupting mutation in one protein drives selection of a compensatory mutation in its partner during evolution. However, this model requires a non-functional intermediate state prior to the compensatory change. Alternatively, a mutation in one protein could first broaden its specificity, allowing changes in its partner, followed by a specificity-restricting mutation. Using bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, we demonstrate the plausibility of this second, promiscuity-based model. By screening large libraries of interface mutants, we show that toxins and antitoxins with high specificity are frequently connected in sequence space to more promiscuous variants that can serve as intermediates during a reprogramming of interaction specificity. We propose that the abundance of promiscuous variants promotes the expansion and diversification of toxin-antitoxin systems and other paralogous protein families during evolution.",,Aakre C.D.; Herrou J.; Phung T.N.; Perchuk B.S.; Crosson S.; Laub M.T.,26.0,725857898.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,7,0.4932191,0.41326424,0.4156684,0.48414478,0.44779468,0.06373310162970519,0.5272006,0.44596255,0.08087512810160191,0.5112988,0.401533,0.07987023269055826,0.4701478,0.38132286,0.07915956011138564,0.4126602,0.15367956459522247,-0.2153966873884201

The S. pombe JmjC family protein Epe1 prevents the ectopic spread of heterochromatin and is itself concentrated at boundaries. Paradoxically, Epe1 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 silencing factors that are distributed throughout heterochromatin. We demonstrate here that the selective enrichment of Epe1 at boundaries requires its regulation by the conserved Cul4-Ddb1Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase, which directly recognizes Epe1 and promotes its polyubiquitylation and degradation. Strikingly, in cells lacking the ligase, Epe1 persists in the body of heterochromatin thereby inducing a defect in gene silencing. Epe1 is the sole target of the Cul4-Ddb1Cdt2 complex whose destruction is necessary for the preservation of heterochromatin. This mechanism acts parallel with phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 by CK2 to restrict Epe1. We conclude that the ubiquitin-dependent sculpting of the chromosomal distribution of an antisilencing factor is critical for heterochromatin boundaries to form correctly. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Braun S.; Garcia J.F.; Rowley M.; Rougemaille M.; Shankar S.; Madhani H.D.,49.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,9,0.85112566,0.62124807,0.57645947,0.78691643,0.5167735,0.11055772221584936,0.61235255,0.5048803,0.10628696647314367,0.54598296,0.32386494,0.0262278503502546,0.7534771,0.4004475,0.10343915396825981,0.66467816,0.8802791237831116,0.29544124007225037

While several cell-adhesion and secreted molecules promote the assembly of synapses, the contribution of signals that negatively regulate synaptogenesis is not well understood. We examined synapse formation in the Caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron DA9, whose presynapses are restricted to a specific segment of its axon. We report that the Wnt lin-44 localizes the Wnt receptor lin-17/Frizzled (Fz) to a subdomain of the DA9 axon that is devoid of presynaptic specializations. When this signaling pathway, composed of the Wnts lin-44 and egl-20, lin-17/Frizzled and dsh-1/Dishevelled, is compromised, synapses develop ectopically in this subdomain. Conversely, overexpression of LIN-44 in cells adjacent to DA9 is sufficient to expand LIN-17 localization within the DA9 axon, thereby inhibiting presynaptic assembly.

By directly tracking mobilization, we show that, during a short and specific time window of oogenesis, retrotransposons achieve massive amplification via a cell-type-specific targeting strategy. Retrotransposons rarely mobilize in undifferentiated germline stem cells. However, as oogenesis proceeds, they utilize supporting nurse cells—which are highly polyploid and eventually undergo apoptosis—as factories to massively manufacture invading products. Moreover, retrotransposons rarely integrate into nurse cells themselves but, instead, via microtubule-mediated transport, they preferentially target the DNA of the interconnected oocytes. Blocking microtubule-dependent intercellular transport from nurse cells significantly alleviates damage to the oocyte genome.

Here, we find that adjacent codon pairs modulate translation efficiency. Deploying an approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that scored the expression of over 35,000 GFP variants in which three adjacent codons were randomized, we have identified 17 pairs of adjacent codons associated with reduced expression. For many pairs, codon order is obligatory for inhibition, implying a more complex interaction than a simple additive effect. Inhibition mediated by adjacent codons occurs during translation itself as GFP expression is restored by increased tRNA levels or by non-native tRNAs with exact-matching anticodons. Inhibition operates in endogenous genes, based on analysis of ribosome profiling data.

We found that lipophilic statin drugs and rationally designed bisphosphonates that target three distinct enzymes in the mevalonate pathway have potent adjuvant activities in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These inhibitors function independently of conventional “danger sensing.” Instead, they inhibit the geranylgeranylation of small GTPases, including Rab5 in antigen-presenting cells, resulting in arrested endosomal maturation, prolonged antigen retention, enhanced antigen presentation, and T cell activation. Additionally, inhibiting the mevalonate pathway enhances antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity, inducing both Th1 and cytolytic T cell responses. As demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models, the mevalonate pathway inhibitors are robust for cancer vaccinations and synergize with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our research thus defines the mevalonate pathway as a druggable target for vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapies.

In loss-of-function mutants, the zygote does not elongate properly, and the cells of the basal lineage are eventually incorporated into the embryo instead of differentiating the extra-embryonic suspensor.

Here, we use optical tweezers to examine the force-dependent stepping behavior of yeast cytoplasmic dynein. We find that dynein primarily advances in 8 nm increments but takes other sized steps (4-24 nm) as well. An opposing force induces more frequent backward stepping by dynein, and the motor walks backward toward the microtubule plus end at loads above its stall force of 7 pN. Remarkably, in the absence of ATP, dynein steps processively along microtubules under an external load, with less force required for minus-end- than for plus-end-directed movement. This nucleotide-independent walking reveals that force alone can drive repetitive microtubule detachment-attachment cycles of dynein's motor domains.

Quantitative morphological analyses of multiple-gene deletion mutants revealed each protein uniquely contributes to a shape-generating pathway. This pathway is required for robust colonization of the stomach in spite of normal directional motility. Our findings suggest that the coordinated action of multiple proteins relaxes peptidoglycan crosslinking, enabling helical cell curvature and twist. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Devbio; Humdisease; Microbio,Sycuro L.K.; Pincus Z.; Gutierrez K.D.; Biboy J.; Stern C.A.; Vollmer W.; Salama N.R.,48.0,3445972.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2010,8,0.771816,0.48435706,0.46698165,0.78724647,0.48609304,0.0814679193326493,0.4112197,0.5044906,0.09981043739049411,0.55440027,0.38108087,0.07336992837600526,0.642688,0.45361674,0.11284371715602404,0.6632634,0.6222097277641296,0.4031314551830292

Mre11 possesses DNA nuclease activities that are highly conserved in evolution but play unknown roles in mammals. To define the functions of Mre11, we engineered targeted mouse alleles that either abrogate nuclease activities or inactivate the entire MRN complex. Mre11 nuclease deficiency causes a striking array of phenotypes indistinguishable from the absence of MRN, including early embryonic lethality and dramatic genomic instability. We identify a crucial role for the nuclease activities in homology-directed double-strand-break repair and a contributing role in activating the ATR kinase. However, the nuclease activities are not required to activate ATM after DNA damage or telomere deprotection. Therefore, nucleolytic processing by Mre11 is an essential function of fundamental importance in DNA repair, distinct from MRN control of ATM signaling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

How this pathway regulates non-developmental processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an essential role for Hippo signaling in innate immunity whereby Yorkie directly regulates the transcription of the Drosophila IκB homolog, Cactus, in Toll receptor-mediated antimicrobial response. Loss of Hippo pathway tumor suppressors or activation of Yorkie in fat bodies, the Drosophila immune organ, leads to elevated cactus mRNA levels, decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides, and vulnerability to infection by Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria acutely activate Hippo-Yorkie signaling in fat bodies via the Toll-Myd88-Pelle cascade through Pelle-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the Cka subunit of the Hippo-inhibitory STRIPAK PP2A complex.

To begin to model human immunity, we analyzed immune parameters in depth both at baseline and in response to influenza vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomes, serum titers, cell subpopulation frequencies, and B cell responses were assessed in 63 individuals before and after vaccination and were used to develop a systematic framework to dissect inter- and intra-individual variation and build predictive models of postvaccination antibody responses. Strikingly, independent of age and pre-existing antibody titers, accurate models could be constructed using pre-perturbation cell populations alone, which were validated using independent baseline time points.

Upon glycosylation of Notch, Dll4-Notch signaling is enhanced, whereas Jagged1 has weak signaling capacity and competes with Dll4.

A/B compartments are first fused into “S1” and “S2” compartments, coinciding with Xist spreading into gene-rich domains. SMCHD1 then binds S1/S2 compartments and merges them to create a compartment-less architecture. Contrary to current views, TADs remain on the Xi but in an attenuated state. Ablating SMCHD1 results in a persistent S1/S2 organization and strengthening of TADs. Furthermore, loss of SMCHD1 causes regional defects in Xist spreading and erosion of heterochromatic silencing.

Whether these functions are coordinated by biochemical or biomechanical processes is unknown. We find that myosin II pulls the rear of the lamellipodial actin network, causing upward bending, edge retraction, and initiation of new adhesion sites. The network then separates from the edge and condenses over the myosin. Protrusion resumes as lamellipodial actin regenerates from the front and extends rearward until it reaches newly assembled myosin, initiating the next cycle. Upward bending, observed by evanescence and electron microscopy, results in ruffle formation when adhesion strength is low. Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy shows that the regenerating lamellipodium forms a cohesive, separable layer of actin above the lamellum. Thus, actin polymerization periodically builds a mechanical link, the lamellipodium, connecting myosin motors with the initiation of adhesion sites, suggesting that the major functions driving motility are coordinated by a biomechanical process. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In vivo silencing of FSIs increased bursting, calcium transients, and AMPA/NMDA ratios in MSNs. In a motor sequence task, FSI silencing increased the frequency of calcium transients but reduced the specificity with which transients aligned to individual task events.

Further, the pyruvate requirement can be fulfilled with an alternative electron acceptor, alpha-ketobutyrate, which provides cells neither carbon nor ATP. Alpha-ketobutyrate restores proliferation when respiration is inhibited, suggesting that an alternative electron acceptor can substitute for respiration to support proliferation.

A major obstacle is the lack of live imaging and image analysis technologies capable of systematically following cellular dynamics across the developing embryo. We developed a light-sheet microscope that adapts itself to the dramatic changes in size, shape, and optical properties of the post-implantation mouse embryo and captures its development from gastrulation to early organogenesis at the cellular level. We furthermore developed a computational framework for reconstructing long-term cell tracks, cell divisions, dynamic fate maps, and maps of tissue morphogenesis across the entire embryo. By jointly analyzing cellular dynamics in multiple embryos registered in space and time, we built a dynamic atlas of post-implantation mouse development that, together with our microscopy and computational methods, is provided as a resource.

However, the mechanism through which the microbiota synergizes with these etiologic factors to promote CRC is not clear. We report that altering the microbiota composition reduces CRC in APCMin/+MSH2-/- mice, and that a diet reduced in carbohydrates phenocopies this effect. Gut microbes did not induce CRC in these mice through an inflammatory response or the production of DNA mutagens but rather by providing carbohydrate-derived metabolites such as butyrate that fuel hyperproliferation of MSH2-/- colon epithelial cells. Further, we provide evidence that the mismatch repair pathway has a role in regulating β-catenin activity and modulating the differentiation of transit-amplifying cells in the colon. These data thereby provide an explanation for the interaction between microbiota, diet, and mismatch repair deficiency in CRC induction.

Retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) proteins mediate IFN production in response to cytosolic double-stranded RNA or single-stranded RNA containing 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp). Cytosolic B form double-stranded DNA, such as poly(dA-dT)•poly(dA-dT) [poly(dA-dT)], can also induce IFN-β, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the cytosolic poly(dA-dT) DNA is converted into 5′-ppp RNA to induce IFN-β through the RIG-I pathway. Biochemical purification led to the identification of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) as the enzyme responsible for synthesizing 5′-ppp RNA from the poly(dA-dT) template. Inhibition of RNA Pol-III prevents IFN-β induction by transfection of DNA or infection with DNA viruses. Furthermore, Pol-III inhibition abrogates IFN-β induction by the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila and promotes the bacterial growth. These results suggest that RNA Pol-III is a cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was observed up to 70 days, and of genomic and subgenomic RNA up to 105 days, after initial diagnosis. The infection was not cleared after the first treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting a limited effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of this individual.

In an effort to discover regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, we performed a eukaryotic expression screen for activators of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, a cardiac-specific marker of hypertrophic signaling. We discovered that a family of transcriptional coactivators, called CAMTAs, promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and activates the ANF gene, at least in part, by associating with the cardiac homeodomain protein Nkx2-5. The transcriptional activity of CAMTAs is governed by association with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), which negatively regulate cardiac growth. Mice homozygous for a mutation in a CAMTA gene are defective in cardiac growth in response to pressure overload and neurohumoral signaling, whereas mice lacking HDAC5, a class II HDAC, are sensitized to the prohypertrophic actions of CAMTA. These findings reveal a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that modulates cardiac growth and gene expression by linking hypertrophic signals to the cardiac genome. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We show here that the Ca2+ and reactive oxygen intermediates generated upon BCR activation rapidly engage in a cooperative interaction that acts in a feedback manner to amplify the early signal generated. This cooperativity acts by regulating the concentration of the oxidant produced. The latter exerts its influence through a pulsed inactivation of receptor-coupled phosphatases, where the amplitude of this pulse is determined by oxidant concentration. The extent of phosphatase inhibition, in turn, dictates what proportion of receptor-proximal kinases are activated and, as a result, the net strength of the initial signal.

These studies show that unliganded and inverse-agonist-bound β2AR exists predominantly in two inactive conformations that exchange within hundreds of microseconds. Although agonists shift the equilibrium toward a conformation capable of engaging cytoplasmic G proteins, they do so incompletely, resulting in increased conformational heterogeneity and the coexistence of inactive, intermediate, and active states.

We report here that RIPLET, an essential E3 ligase in antiviral immunity, promotes the antiviral signaling activity of the viral RNA receptor RIG-I through both Ub-dependent and -independent manners. RIPLET uses its dimeric structure and a bivalent binding mode to preferentially recognize and ubiquitinate RIG-I pre-oligomerized on dsRNA. In addition, RIPLET can cross-bridge RIG-I filaments on longer dsRNAs, inducing aggregate-like RIG-I assemblies. The consequent receptor clustering synergizes with the Ub-dependent mechanism to amplify RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling in an RNA-length dependent manner. These observations show the unexpected role of an E3 ligase as a co-receptor that directly participates in receptor oligomerization and ligand discrimination. It also highlights a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the innate immune system measures foreign nucleic acid length, a common criterion for self versus non-self nucleic acid discrimination.

In addition, a mobile loop from the domain harboring the E1 catalytic cysteine contributes to E2 binding. Significant, experimentally observed motions in the UFD around a hinge in the linker connecting this domain to the rest of the enzyme suggest a conformation-dependent mechanism for the transthioesterification function of Uba1; however, this mechanism clearly differs from that of other E1 enzymes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, the significance of this function has remained unclear. We show that efficient protein translocation into the ER is incompatible with normal cellular translation rates due to rate-limiting concentrations of SRP receptor (SR). We complemented mammalian cells depleted of SRP14 by expressing mutant versions of the protein lacking the elongation arrest function. The absence of a delay caused inefficient targeting of preproteins leading to defects in secretion, depletion of proteins in the endogenous membranes, and reduced cell growth. The detrimental effects were reversed by either reducing the cellular protein synthesis rate or increasing SR expression. SRP therefore ensures that nascent chains remain translocation competent during the targeting time window dictated by SR. Since SRP-signal sequence affinities vary, the delay may also regulate which proteins are preferentially targeted. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Similar to eukaryotes, bacteria possess centromere-like DNA sequences (parS) that cluster at the origin of replication and the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes for faithful chromosome segregation. In Bacillus subtilis, parS sites are bound by the partitioning protein Spo0J (ParB), and we show here that Spo0J recruits the SMC complex to the origin. We demonstrate that the SMC complex colocalizes with Spo0J at the origin and that insertion of parS sites near the replication terminus targets SMC to this position leading to defects in chromosome organization and segregation. Consistent with these findings, the subcellular localization of the SMC complex is disrupted in the absence of Spo0J or the parS sites.

This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites.

A final posttranscriptional step in gene expression is the turnover of the mRNP, which involves degradation of the mRNA and recycling of associated proteins. How tightly associated protein components are released from degrading mRNPs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ATPase activity of the RNA helicase Upf1 allows disassembly of mRNPs undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the absence of Upf1 ATPase activity, partially degraded NMD mRNA intermediates accumulate in complex with NMD factors and concentrate in processing bodies. Thus, disassembly and completion of turnover of mRNPs undergoing NMD requires ATP hydrolysis by Upf1.

Comparative graph theoretical analysis reveals a striking pattern of neuronal wiring with increased connectional complexity in the anterior pharynx correlating with tooth-like denticles, a morphological feature in the mouth of P. pacificus. We apply focused centrality methods to identify neurons I1 and I2 as candidates for regulating predatory feeding and predict substantial divergence in the function of pharyngeal glands. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Bumbarger D.J.; Riebesell M.; Rodelsperger C.; Sommer R.J.,77.0,717971076.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,0.63742095,0.53747004,0.5748356,0.50088894,0.4598559,0.06383870913691686,0.544054,0.4560516,0.06927562125309072,0.6938564,0.33771622,0.06529336597499236,0.47093278,0.44018292,0.08913825170029827,0.4011356,0.3556549549102783,-0.11638136953115463

While the presence of m6A on transcripts can impact nuclear RNA fates, a reader of this mark that mediates processing of nuclear transcripts has not been identified. We find that the RNA-binding protein HNRNPA2B1 binds m6A-bearing RNAs in vivo and in vitro and its biochemical footprint matches the m6A consensus motif. HNRNPA2B1 directly binds a set of nuclear transcripts and elicits similar alternative splicing effects as the m6A writer METTL3. Moreover, HNRNPA2B1 binds to m6A marks in a subset of primary miRNA transcripts, interacts with the microRNA Microprocessor complex protein DGCR8, and promotes primary miRNA processing. Also, HNRNPA2B1 loss and METTL3 depletion cause similar processing defects for these pri-miRNA precursors. We propose HNRNPA2B1 to be a nuclear reader of the m6A mark and to mediate, in part, this mark's effects on primary microRNA processing and alternative splicing.

Ubiquitin exists as monomers, unanchored chains, or protein-conjugated forms, but the regulation of these interconversions remains largely unknown.

Rfu1 functions as an inhibitor of Doa4, a deubiquitinating enzyme. Rapid loss of free ubiquitin chains upon heat shock, a condition in which more proteins require ubiquitin conjugation, was mediated in part by Doa4 and Rfu1. Thus, regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis is controlled by a balance between a deubiquitinating enzyme and its inhibitor.

Cross-linking of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) leads to degranulation and allergic inflammation; however, the regulatory mechanisms of IgE-dependent exocytosis remain unknown. We show here that IκB kinase (IKK) 2 in mast cells plays critical roles in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in vivo, and IgE-mediated degranulation in vitro, in an NF-kB-independent manner. Upon FcεRI stimulation, IKK2 phosphorylates SNAP-23, the target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE), and ectopic expression of a phospho-mimetic mutant of SNAP-23 partially rescued the impaired IgE-mediated degranulation in IKK2-deficient mast cells. These results suggest that IKK2 phosphorylation of SNAP-23 leads to degranulation and anaphylactic reactions. While this reaction is NF-kB-independent, we additionally show that IKK2 also regulates late-phase allergic reactions promoted by the release of proinflammatory cytokines in an NF-kB-dependent manner.

Their abundance in cells experiencing mechanical stress led us to investigate their role in membrane-mediated mechanical response. Acute mechanical stress induced by osmotic swelling or by uniaxial stretching results in a rapid disappearance of caveolae, in a reduced caveolin/Cavin1 interaction, and in an increase of free caveolins at the plasma membrane. Tether-pulling force measurements in cells and in plasma membrane spheres demonstrate that caveola flattening and disassembly is the primary actin- and ATP-independent cell response that buffers membrane tension surges during mechanical stress. Conversely, stress release leads to complete caveola reassembly in an actin- and ATP-dependent process. The absence of a functional caveola reservoir in myotubes from muscular dystrophic patients enhanced membrane fragility under mechanical stress. Our findings support a new role for caveolae as a physiological membrane reservoir that quickly accommodates sudden and acute mechanical stresses.

Here, we report that siRNAs and miRNAs are sorted into Ago1 and Ago2 by pathways independent from the processes that produce these two classes of small RNAs. Such small-RNA sorting reflects the structure of the double-stranded assembly intermediates-the miRNA/miRNA* and siRNA duplexes-from which Argonaute proteins are loaded. We find that the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer acts as a gatekeeper for the assembly of Ago2 complexes, promoting the incorporation of siRNAs and disfavoring miRNAs as loading substrates for Drosophila Ago2. A separate mechanism acts in parallel to favor miRNA/miRNA* duplexes and exclude siRNAs from assembly into Ago1 complexes.

We observed force-induced progressive unraveling of ssDNA from the SSB surface between 1 and 6 pN, followed by SSB dissociation at ∼10 pN, and obtained experimental evidence of a reptation mechanism for protein movement along DNA wherein a protein slides via DNA bulge formation and propagation.

We use the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) paradigm to explore the implication of chromatin changes in gene silencing. Using female mouse embryonic stem cells, we initiate XCI by inducing Xist and then monitor the temporal changes in transcription and chromatin by allele-specific profiling. This reveals histone deacetylation and H2AK119 ubiquitination as the earliest chromatin alterations during XCI. We show that HDAC3 is pre-bound on the X chromosome and that, upon Xist coating, its activity is required for efficient gene silencing. We also reveal that first PRC1-associated H2AK119Ub and then PRC2-associated H3K27me3 accumulate initially at large intergenic domains that can then spread into genes only in the context of histone deacetylation and gene silencing.

We have examined cell-cycle progression in a yeast strain from which the origin recognition complex protein Orc2 was depleted after the assembly of prereplication complexes. We find that Orc2 depletion causes a delay in progression through mitosis, reflecting activation of both the DNA-damage and Mad2-spindle checkpoints. Surprisingly, sister-chromatid cohesion is impaired in Orc2-depleted cells, although Cohesin subunits are properly associated with chromatin. Reexpression of Orc2 in late G2/M phase restores chromatid cohesion. Finally, the targeting of Orc2 to a specific chromosomal locus suppresses premature sister-chromatid separation locally in a temperature-sensitive cohesin mutant.

By monitoring multiple system quantities (e.g., cell volume, Hog1, glycerol) and using varied input waveforms (e.g., steps and ramps), we assess in a minimally invasive manner the network location of the mechanism responsible for perfect adaptation.

Based on clusters of isoforms with different half-lives, we identify hundreds of sequences conferring stabilization or destabilization upon mRNAs terminating downstream. One class of stabilizing element is a polyU sequence that can interact with poly(A) tails, inhibit the association of poly(A)-binding protein, and confer increased stability upon introduction into ectopic transcripts. More generally, destabilizing and stabilizing elements are linked to the propensity of the poly(A) tail to engage in double-stranded structures.

Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset with a poor prognosis, representing 30%-40% of human PDAC, characterized by reduced SIRT6 expression and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth.

Our analyses of replication at specific DNA sequences support a long-standing hypothesis that sister replication forks generated from the same origin stay associated with each other within a replication factory while the entire replicon is replicated. This assay system allows replication to be studied at extremely high temporal resolution in individual cells, thereby opening a window into how replication dynamics vary from cell to cell. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR's intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Arkhipov A.; Shan Y.; Das R.; Endres N.F.; Eastwood M.P.; Wemmer D.E.; Kuriyan J.; Shaw D.E.,63.0,717976889.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,1.0617455,0.68510944,0.6430166,1.0173656,0.4206624,0.08156877970538517,0.5370615,0.3810389,0.05273528477106332,0.5369374,0.50104314,0.11278929022585604,0.62054855,0.4107381,0.04565484440424755,0.47478995,0.38680315017700195,0.17033447325229645

Land plants evolved from an ancestral charophycean alga from which they inherited developmental, biochemical, and cell biological attributes. Additional biochemical and physiological adaptations to land, and a life cycle with an alternation between multicellular haploid and diploid generations that facilitated efficient dispersal of desiccation tolerant spores, evolved in the ancestral land plant. We analyzed the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a member of a basal land plant lineage. Relative to charophycean algae, land plant genomes are characterized by genes encoding novel biochemical pathways, new phytohormone signaling pathways (notably auxin), expanded repertoires of signaling pathways, and increased diversity in some transcription factor families. Compared with other sequenced land plants, M. polymorpha exhibits low genetic redundancy in most regulatory pathways, with this portion of its genome resembling that predicted for the ancestral land plant.

It remains unclear how the APC-or many other E3s-promotes the multiple distinct reactions necessary for chain assembly. We addressed this problem by analyzing APC interactions with different E2s. We screened all budding yeast E2s as APC coenzymes in vitro and found that two, Ubc4 and Ubc1, are the key E2 partners for the APC. These proteins display strikingly different but complementary enzymatic behaviors: Ubc4 supports the rapid monoubiquitination of multiple lysines on APC targets, while Ubc1 catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitin chain assembly on preattached ubiquitins. Mitotic APC function is lost in yeast strains lacking both Ubc1 and Ubc4. E2-25K, a human homolog of Ubc1, also promotes APC-dependent chain extension on preattached ubiquitins.

Studies in germ-free mice monocolonized with integrase-competent, integrase-deficient, and integrase-transgenic Bacteroides demonstrate that the microbial epitope promotes the recruitment of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells to the gut.

Such memory decay is thought to result either from the inherently labile nature of newly acquired memories or from interference by subsequently attained information. Here we report that a small G protein Rac-dependent forgetting mechanism contributes to both passive memory decay and interference-induced forgetting in Drosophila. Inhibition of Rac activity leads to slower decay of early memory, extending it from a few hours to more than one day, and to blockade of interference-induced forgetting. Conversely, elevated Rac activity in mushroom body neurons accelerates memory decay. This forgetting mechanism does not affect memory acquisition and is independent of Rutabaga adenylyl cyclase-mediated memory formation mechanisms. Endogenous Rac activation is evoked on different time scales during gradual memory loss in passive decay and during acute memory removal in reversal learning. We suggest that Rac's role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling may contribute to memory erasure. PaperClip: {An electronic component is presented}. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we describe upSET, a transcriptional regulator encoding a SET domain-containing protein recruited to active and inducible genes in Drosophila. However, unlike other Drosophila SET proteins associated with gene transcription, UpSET is part of an Rpd3/Sin3-containing complex that restricts chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation to promoter regions. In the absence of UpSET, active chromatin marks and chromatin accessibility increase and spread to genic and flanking regions due to destabilization of the histone deacetylase complex. Consistent with this, transcriptional noise increases, as manifest by activation of repetitive elements and off-target genes. Interestingly, upSET mutant flies are female sterile due to upregulation of key components of Notch signaling during oogenesis. Thus UpSET defines a class of metazoan transcriptional regulators required to fine tune transcription by preventing the spread of active chromatin. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Rincon-Arano H.; Halow J.; Delrow J.J.; Parkhurst S.M.; Groudine M.,80.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2012,8,0.61563456,0.5279144,0.42470515,0.6186563,0.49841452,0.06831073615978406,0.38348204,0.5065661,0.09901402645639429,0.45230344,0.2006154,0.047998072940056924,0.35205966,0.42855692,0.09628086193346158,0.57564455,0.5340203046798706,0.16536834836006165

We report here that partially spliced pre-mRNAs containing minor-class introns undergo nuclear export and that minor-class snRNAs are predominantly cytoplasmic in vertebrates. Cytoplasmic interference with the minor spliceosome further indicated its functional segregation from the nucleus. In keeping with this, minor splicing was only weakly affected during mitosis. By selectively interfering with snRNA function in zebrafish development and in mammalian cells, we revealed a conserved role for minor splicing in cell-cycle progression. We argue that the segregation of the splicing systems allows for processing of partially unspliced cytoplasmic transcripts, emerging as a result of different splicing rates.

Here, we show that macroautophagy requires the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related protein presenilin-1 (PS1). In PS1 null blastocysts, neurons from mice hypomorphic for PS1 or conditionally depleted of PS1, substrate proteolysis and autophagosome clearance during macroautophagy are prevented as a result of a selective impairment of autolysosome acidification and cathepsin activation. These deficits are caused by failed PS1-dependent targeting of the v-ATPase V0a1 subunit to lysosomes. N-glycosylation of the V0a1 subunit, essential for its efficient ER-to-lysosome delivery, requires the selective binding of PS1 holoprotein to the unglycosylated subunit and the Sec61alpha/oligosaccharyltransferase complex. PS1 mutations causing early-onset AD produce a similar lysosomal/autophagy phenotype in fibroblasts from AD patients.

Using yeast proteome microarrays, we identified and validated many nonchromatin substrates of the essential nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) complex. Among these, acetylation sites (Lys19 and 514) of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1p) were determined by tandem mass spectrometry. Acetylation at Lys514 was crucial for enzymatic activity and the ability of yeast cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. Furthermore, Sir2p deacetylated Pck1p both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of Pck1p activity blocked the extension of yeast chronological life span caused by water starvation. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells, human Pck1 acetylation and glucose production were dependent on TIP60, the human homolog of ESA1.

Coordination of two morphogenetic processes - convergent extension and neural-plate apical constriction - ensures the complete closure of the neural tube. We now provide evidence that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling directly links these two processes. In the bending neural plates, we find that a PCP-regulating cadherin, Celsr1, is concentrated in adherens junctions (AJs) oriented toward the mediolateral axes of the plates. At these AJs, Celsr1 cooperates with Dishevelled, DAAM1, and the PDZ-RhoGEF to upregulate Rho kinase, causing their actomyosin-dependent contraction in a planar-polarized manner. This planar-polarized contraction promotes simultaneous apical constriction and midline convergence of neuroepithelial cells. Together our findings demonstrate that PCP signals confer anisotropic contractility on the AJs, producing cellular forces that promote the polarized bending of the neural plate. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Nishimura T.; Honda H.; Takeichi M.,48.0,716747813.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2012,8,1.2400146,0.6505956,0.64604217,1.3560228,0.44808078,0.06340379054705753,0.56941146,0.48494565,0.08199922952714384,0.6056686,0.38478374,0.07173203142438778,0.5986215,0.42364597,0.09491160449839126,0.7004441,0.5300194025039673,0.29934218525886536

Spermiogenic mRNAs are transcribed earlier and stored in a translationally inert state until needed for translation; however, it remains largely unclear how such repressed mRNAs become activated during spermiogenesis. We previously reported that the MIWI/piRNA machinery is responsible for mRNA elimination during late spermiogenesis in preparation for spermatozoa production. Here we unexpectedly discover that the same machinery is also responsible for activating translation of a subset of spermiogenic mRNAs to coordinate with morphological transformation into spermatozoa. Such action requires specific base-pairing interactions of piRNAs with target mRNAs in their 3′ UTRs, which activates translation through coupling with cis-acting AU-rich elements to nucleate the formation of a MIWI/piRNA/eIF3f/HuR super-complex in a developmental stage-specific manner.

By measuring kinetic parameters of KRas dynamics in living cells with a cellular-automata-based data-fitting approach in realistic cell-geometries, we show that charge-based specificity is not sufficient to generate PM enrichment in light of the total surface area of endomembranes. Instead, mislocalized KRas is continuously sequestered from endomembranes by cytosolic PDEδ to be unloaded in an Arl2-dependent manner to perinuclear membranes.

Recent studies have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model, we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance. These schedules led to superior survival in mice. Our interdisciplinary approach may also be applicable to other human cancer types treated with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for significantly increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic therapy.

In the first step, differential Hedgehog pathway activity in peripheral sensory organ precursors creates ORN populations with different levels of the Patched receptor. Different Patched levels in ORNs then determine axonal responsiveness to target-derived Hedgehog in the brain: only ORN axons that do not express high levels of Patched are responsive to and require a second step of Hedgehog signaling for target selection. Hedgehog signaling in the imaginal sensory organ precursors thus confers differential ORN responsiveness to Hedgehog-mediated axon targeting in the brain. This mechanism contributes to the spatial coordination of ORN cell bodies in the periphery and their glomerular targets in the brain.

Through phylogenomic studies, a group of streptophyte algae, the Zygnematophyceae, have recently been recognized as the likely sister group to land plants (embryophytes). Here, we report genome sequences and analyses of two early diverging Zygnematophyceae (Spirogloea muscicola gen. nov. and Mesotaenium endlicherianum) that share the same subaerial/terrestrial habitat with the earliest-diverging embryophytes, the bryophytes. We provide evidence that genes (i.e., GRAS and PYR/PYL/RCAR) that increase resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in land plants, in particular desiccation, originated or expanded in the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes, and were gained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from soil bacteria. These two Zygnematophyceae genomes represent a cornerstone for future studies to understand the underlying molecular mechanism and process of plant terrestrialization. © 2019The genomes of two streptophyte algal species, including a newly identified lineage placed closest to the branch point separating green algae and land plants, are reported and provide evidence that genes thought to be important for resistance to desiccation were gained by horizontal gene transfer from soil bacteria approximately 580 million years ago.",evolution of land plants; genome sequences; GRAS; horizontal gene transfer; phylogenomics; PYR/PYL/RCAR; soil bacteria; Spirogloeophycidae; Zygnematophyceae,Cheng S.; Xian W.; Fu Y.; Marin B.; Keller J.; Wu T.; Sun W.; Li X.; Xu Y.; Zhang Y.; Wittek S.; Reder T.; Gunther G.; Gontcharov A.; Wang S.; Li L.; Liu X.; Wang J.; Yang H.; Xu X.; Delaux P.-M.; Melkonian B.; Wong G.K.-S.; Melkonian M.,89.0,736902289.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2019,9,0.9112587,0.514444,0.5071465,0.844905,0.39216626,0.037632019654307514,0.5089116,0.3748448,0.033913709180277196,0.5764806,0.3331536,0.08532088111641989,0.51704603,0.21950269,0.016509579506375494,0.4887909,-0.18084605038166046,0.11449311673641205

Inactivation of AAA proteases causes pleiotropic phenotypes in various organisms, including respiratory deficiencies, mitochondrial morphology defects, and axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The molecular basis of these defects, however, remained unclear. Here, we describe a regulatory role of an AAA protease for mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast. The mitochondrial ribosomal protein MrpL32 is processed by the m-AAA protease, allowing its association with preassembled ribosomal particles and completion of ribosome assembly in close proximity to the inner membrane. Maturation of MrpL32 and mitochondrial protein synthesis are also impaired in a HSP mouse model lacking the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin, demonstrating functional conservation. Our findings therefore rationalize mitochondrial defects associated with m-AAA protease mutants in yeast and shed new light on the mechanism of axonal degeneration in HSP.

ZBP1 initiates RIPK3-driven cell death by sensing IAV RNA and activating RIPK3. Here, we show that replicating IAV generates Z-RNAs, which activate ZBP1 in the nucleus of infected cells. ZBP1 then initiates RIPK3-mediated MLKL activation in the nucleus, resulting in nuclear envelope disruption, leakage of DNA into the cytosol, and eventual necroptosis. Cell death induced by nuclear MLKL was a potent activator of neutrophils, a cell type known to drive inflammatory pathology in virulent IAV disease. Consequently, MLKL-deficient mice manifest reduced nuclear disruption of lung epithelia, decreased neutrophil recruitment into infected lungs, and increased survival following a lethal dose of IAV.

Similarly, BAI adhesion-GPCRs were associated with numerous activities, but their ligands and functions remain unclear. Using unbiased approaches, we observed an unexpected convergence: RTN4 receptors are high-affinity ligands for BAI adhesion-GPCRs. A single thrombospondin type 1-repeat (TSR) domain of BAIs binds to the leucine-rich repeat domain of all three RTN4-receptor isoforms with nanomolar affinity. In the 1.65 Å crystal structure of the BAI1/RTN4-receptor complex, C-mannosylation of tryptophan and O-fucosylation of threonine in the BAI TSR-domains creates a RTN4-receptor/BAI interface shaped by unusual glycoconjugates that enables high-affinity interactions. In human neurons, RTN4 receptors regulate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation by differential binding to glial versus neuronal BAIs, thereby controlling neural network activity. Thus, BAI binding to RTN4/NoGo receptors represents a receptor-ligand axis that, enabled by rare post-translational modifications, controls development of synaptic circuits.",adhesion-GPCR; BAI; C-mannosylation; human neuron; morphology; neuronal network activity; NoGo receptor; O-fucosylation; RTN4R; synapse formation; synaptic transmission,Wang J.; Miao Y.; Wicklein R.; Sun Z.; Wang J.; Jude K.M.; Fernandes R.A.; Merrill S.A.; Wernig M.; Garcia K.C.; Sudhof T.C.,90.0,741130829.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2021,8,0.36544642,0.32524085,0.32546714,0.36784694,0.49885416,0.08571994748530803,0.52335644,0.50481546,0.09995396900237713,0.6073814,0.4198842,0.06155393115549235,0.6439004,0.39148104,0.02842800218888375,0.6307901,0.6052886247634888,-0.13256941735744476

Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats. rDNA in metaphase, unlike most other sequences, remains in an undercondensed and topologically entangled state. Separase, concomitantly with cleaving cohesin, activates the phosphatase Cdc14. We find that Cdc14 exerts two effects on rDNA, both mediated by the condensin complex.

Bacteria often employ tens or hundreds of these paralogous signaling systems, comprised of histidine kinases (HKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Faithful transmission of information through these signaling pathways and avoidance of detrimental crosstalk demand exquisite specificity of HK-RR interactions. To identify the determinants of two-component signaling specificity, we examined patterns of amino acid coevolution in large, multiple sequence alignments of cognate kinase-regulator pairs. Guided by these results, we demonstrate that a subset of the coevolving residues is sufficient, when mutated, to completely switch the substrate specificity of the kinase EnvZ. Our results shed light on the basis of molecular discrimination in two-component signaling pathways, provide a general approach for the rational rewiring of these pathways, and suggest that analyses of coevolution may facilitate the reprogramming of other signaling systems and protein-protein interactions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The competing challenges of developing selective 5-HT2C receptor ligands or creating drugs with a defined polypharmacological profile, especially aimed at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), remain extremely difficult.

Consequently, hepatic Mfn2 deficiency reduces PS transfer and phospholipid synthesis, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of a NASH-like phenotype and liver cancer.

We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-β mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-β induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-β-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-β-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-β. TGF-β-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis.

We then applied this method to the Denisovan and offer a putative morphological profile. We suggest that Denisovans likely shared with Neanderthals traits such as an elongated face and a wide pelvis. We also identify Denisovan-derived changes, such as an increased dental arch and lateral cranial expansion. Our predictions match the only morphologically informative Denisovan bone to date, as well as the Xuchang skull, which was suggested by some to be a Denisovan. We conclude that DNA methylation can be used to reconstruct anatomical features, including some that do not survive in the fossil record.",aDNA; Denisova; disease; jaw; loss of function; methylome; Neanderthal; paleoepigenetics; paleogenomics; phenotype,Gokhman D.; Mishol N.; de Manuel M.; de Juan D.; Shuqrun J.; Meshorer E.; Marques-Bonet T.; Rak Y.; Carmel L.,82.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,8,0.51821196,0.42055073,0.41086936,0.52180487,0.29791617,0.00973659669217286,0.38574794,0.3152355,0.0270447128771652,0.3042383,0.34908152,0.08221682370155398,0.36378253,0.18999696,0.02081898492610673,0.34916252,-0.31692972779273987,-0.6597310900688171

Here, we directly observe single dyneins during meiotic nuclear oscillations in fission yeast and identify the steps of the dynein binding process: from the cytoplasm to the microtubule and from the microtubule to cortical anchors. We observed that dyneins on the microtubule move either in a diffusive or directed manner, with the switch from diffusion to directed movement occurring upon binding of dynein to cortical anchors. This dual behavior of dynein on the microtubule, together with the two steps of binding, enables dyneins to self-organize into a spatial pattern needed for them to generate large collective forces. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Ananthanarayanan V.; Schattat M.; Vogel S.K.; Krull A.; Pavin N.; Tolic-Norrelykke I.M.,63.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,7,0.4926766,0.32854962,0.464659,0.49645782,0.43077838,0.055025036056965404,0.42376408,0.47010148,0.06600251856151218,0.5092554,0.36162603,0.08155459120240721,0.66965675,0.40695286,0.06509875438884721,0.71257824,0.11081419885158539,0.36657556891441345

However, the nonmitotic functions of Cdc20-APC have remained unexplored. We report that Cdc20-APC plays an essential role in dendrite morphogenesis in postmitotic neurons. Knockdown of Cdc20 in cerebellar slices and in postnatal rats in vivo profoundly impairs the formation of granule neuron dendrite arbors in the cerebellar cortex. Remarkably, Cdc20 is enriched at the centrosome in neurons, and the centrosomal localization is critical for Cdc20-dependent dendrite development. We also find that the centrosome-associated protein histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) promotes the polyubiquitination of Cdc20, stimulates the activity of centrosomal Cdc20-APC, and drives the differentiation of dendrites. These findings define a postmitotic function for Cdc20-APC in the morphogenesis of dendrites in the mammalian brain. The identification of a centrosomal Cdc20-APC ubiquitin signaling pathway holds important implications for diverse biological processes, including neuronal connectivity and plasticity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Overall, the signaling that regulates stem cell dormancy in the HSC niche remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β type II receptor-deficient HSCs show low-level Smad activation and impaired long-term repopulating activity, underlining the critical role of TGF-β/Smad signaling in HSC maintenance. TGF-β is produced as a latent form by a variety of cells, so we searched for those that express activator molecules for latent TGF-β. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells in BM proved responsible for activation. These glial cells ensheathed autonomic nerves, expressed HSC niche factor genes, and were in contact with a substantial proportion of HSCs. Autonomic nerve denervation reduced the number of these active TGF-β-producing cells and led to rapid loss of HSCs from BM. We propose that glial cells are components of a BM niche and maintain HSC hibernation by regulating activation of latent TGF-β. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Yamazaki S.; Ema H.; Karlsson G.; Yamaguchi T.; Miyoshi H.; Shioda S.; Taketo M.M.; Karlsson S.; Iwama A.; Nakauchi H.,55.0,13460957.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,7,1.3020744,0.6505956,0.62391996,1.2881109,0.49141896,0.07020610885585066,0.5146911,0.49321604,0.08688068831794465,0.49350953,0.3165959,0.024191782345949098,0.59375155,0.4805298,0.1036706313698395,0.49170527,0.9134015440940857,0.45623311400413513

Among the factors proposed to mediate tethering are a set of multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs). The Dsl1 complex, with only three subunits, is the simplest known MTC and is essential for the retrograde traffic of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi to the ER. To elucidate structural principles underlying MTC function, we have determined the structure of the Dsl1 complex, revealing a tower containing at its base the binding sites for two ER SNAREs and at its tip a flexible lasso for capturing vesicles. The Dsl1 complex binds to individual SNAREs via their N-terminal regulatory domains and also to assembled SNARE complexes; moreover, it is capable of accelerating SNARE complex assembly.

We present here a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the prevalence, mutational spectrum, and functional consequences of microsatellite instability (MSI) in cancer genomes. We analyzed MSI in 277 colorectal and endometrial cancer genomes (including 57 microsatellite-unstable ones) using exome and whole-genome sequencing data. Recurrent MSI events in coding sequences showed tumor type specificity, elevated frameshift-to-inframe ratios, and lower transcript levels than wild-type alleles. Moreover, genome-wide analysis revealed differences in the distribution of MSI versus point mutations, including overrepresentation of MSI in euchromatic and intronic regions compared to heterochromatic and intergenic regions, respectively, and depletion of MSI at nucleosome-occupied sequences. Our results provide a panoramic view of MSI in cancer genomes, highlighting their tumor type specificity, impact on gene expression, and the role of chromatin organization. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Kim T.-M.; Laird P.W.; Park P.J.,59.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,7,1.0079774,0.6201642,0.55814356,1.0177323,0.45102978,0.038475221456824804,0.31401438,0.4821819,0.0770829271340156,0.55268395,0.34537232,0.07981775614955844,0.5065076,0.39183557,0.0727232002943054,0.44104135,0.11072975397109985,-0.33279457688331604

Crucially, animal behavior in natural settings implies that the brain can represent hypothetical future experience not only quickly but also constantly over time, as external events continually unfold. To determine how this is possible, we recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of rats navigating a maze with multiple spatial paths. We found neural activity encoding two possible future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz: one scenario per ∼125-ms cycle. Further, we found that the underlying dynamics of cycling (both inter- and intra-cycle dynamics) generalized across qualitatively different representational correlates (location and direction). Notably, cycling occurred across moving behaviors, including during running. These findings identify a general dynamic process capable of quickly and continually representing hypothetical experience, including that of multiple possible futures.

However, the appearance of DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors may turn TRs into functional cis-regulatory elements, thus favoring their stabilization in genomes. Here, we show that, in human cells, the transcriptional repressor ZEB1, which promotes the maintenance of mesenchymal features largely by suppressing epithelial genes and microRNAs, occupies TRs harboring dozens of copies of its DNA-binding motif within genomic loci relevant for maintenance of epithelial identity. The deletion of one such TR caused quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to reacquire epithelial features, partially recapitulating the effects of ZEB1 gene deletion. These data demonstrate that the high density of identical motifs in TRs can make them suitable platforms for recruitment of transcriptional repressors, thus promoting their exaptation into pre-existing cis-regulatory networks.

In many instances, how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a protein, F17 encoded by cytoplasmically replicating poxviruses, that binds and sequesters Raptor and Rictor, regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. This disrupts mTORC1-mTORC2 crosstalk that coordinates host responses to poxvirus infection. During infection with poxvirus lacking F17, cGAS accumulates together with endoplasmic reticulum vesicles around the Golgi, where activated STING puncta form, leading to interferon-stimulated gene expression. By contrast, poxvirus expressing F17 dysregulates mTOR, which localizes to the Golgi and blocks these antiviral responses in part through mTOR-dependent cGAS degradation. Ancestral conservation of Raptor/Rictor across eukaryotes, along with expression of F17 across poxviruses, suggests that mTOR dysregulation forms a conserved poxvirus strategy to counter cytosolic sensing while maintaining the metabolic benefits of mTOR activity.

TAC generation is independent of autocrine SHH, but the TAC pool wanes if they can't produce SHH. We trace this paradox to two direct actions of SHH: promoting quiescent-SC proliferation and regulating dermal factors that stoke TAC expansion. Ingrained within quiescent SCs' special sensitivity to SHH signaling is their high expression of GAS1. Without sufficient input from quiescent SCs, replenishment of primed SCs for the next hair cycle is compromised, delaying regeneration and eventually leading to regeneration failure.

This enhances loading of proteasomes with Ubp6, thereby altering proteasome function. A catalytically inactive mutant of Ubp6 fails to recycle ubiquitin and also inhibits proteasome function directly, thus inducing both ubiquitin stress and proteasome stress. These results show that homeostatic control of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can be achieved through signal-dependent, subunit-specific regulation of the proteasome, and indicate a dual role of Ubp6 in regulating ubiquitin levels and proteasome function. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While a number of molecular features have emerged, the underlying causal mechanisms behind the disorder remain obscure. Here, we find that increased complex formation between angiotensin II AT1 and bradykinin B2, two G protein-coupled receptors with opposing effects on blood vessel constriction, triggers symptoms of preeclampsia in pregnant mice. Aberrant heteromerization of AT1-B2 led to exaggerated calcium signaling and high vascular smooth muscle mechanosensitivity, which could explain the onset of preeclampsia symptoms at late-stage pregnancy as mechanical forces increase with fetal mass. AT1-B2 receptor aggregation was inhibited by beta-arrestin-mediated downregulation. Importantly, symptoms of preeclampsia were prevented by transgenic ARRB1 expression or a small-molecule drug. Because AT1-B2 heteromerization was found to occur in human placental biopsies from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, specifically targeting AT1-B2 heteromerization and its downstream consequences represents a promising therapeutic approach. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.This paper provides a mechanistic understanding of the causes of preeclampsia and uses the newly gained insights to explore treatment for the condition.",AGTR1; amlodipine; angiotensin II; ARRB1; BDKRB2; biased agonist; bradykinin; heterodimer; mechanosensitivity; preeclampsia,Quitterer U.; Fu X.; Pohl A.; Bayoumy K.M.; Langer A.; AbdAlla S.,60.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,7,0.51821196,0.42055073,0.41086936,0.52180487,0.5142207,0.09102234862374725,0.59017855,0.49499428,0.0980567945160451,0.5211623,0.45775938,0.09697201236430802,0.72961915,0.25102437,0.036464199470205794,0.62590575,0.37316375970840454,-0.0742129310965538

We show that transient activation of Src oncoprotein can mediate an epigenetic switch from immortalized breast cells to a stably transformed line that forms self-renewing mammospheres that contain cancer stem cells. Src activation triggers an inflammatory response mediated by NF-κB that directly activates Lin28 transcription and rapidly reduces let-7 microRNA levels. Let-7 directly inhibits IL6 expression, resulting in higher levels of IL6 than achieved by NF-κB activation. IL6-mediated activation of the STAT3 transcription factor is necessary for transformation, and IL6 activates NF-κB, thereby completing a positive feedback loop. This regulatory circuit operates in other cancer cells lines, and its transcriptional signature is found in human cancer tissues.

Yeast proteasomes contain two deubiquitinating enzymes, Ubp6 and Rpn11. Rpn11 promotes protein breakdown through its degradation-coupled activity. In contrast, we show here that Ubp6 has the capacity to delay the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome. However, delay of degradation by Ubp6 does not require its catalytic activity, indicating that Ubp6 has both deubiquitinating activity and proteasome-inhibitory activity. Delay of degradation by Ubp6 appears to provide a time window allowing gradual deubiquitination of the substrate by Ubp6. Rpn11 catalyzes en bloc chain removal, and Ubp6 interferes with degradation at or upstream of this step, so that degradation delay by Ubp6 is accompanied by a switch in the mode of ubiquitin chain processing.

Consequently, these coordinated NPC actions result in simultaneous activation of diverse stress-related signaling pathways and constitute an essential regulatory mechanism specific for ETI/PCD induction.",,Gu Y.; Zebell S.G.; Liang Z.; Wang S.; Kang B.-H.; Dong X.,50.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.49362242,0.41326424,0.41387397,0.485274,0.41670775,0.07109809740680006,0.6807911,0.5094612,0.08940630670937888,0.6092675,0.40436685,0.048768041503413906,0.5623265,0.39694965,0.1157895081187057,0.70084244,0.24774421751499176,0.24024158716201782

This CBE activity becomes particularly striking upon IGCR1 inactivation, which allows RAG, likely via loop extrusion, to linearly scan chromatin far upstream.

The detailed process by which chromosomes are bioriented and how biorientation is coordinated with spindle assembly and chromosome congression remain unclear. Here, we provide complete 3D kinetochore-tracking datasets throughout cell division by high-resolution imaging of meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. We show that in acentrosomal oocytes, chromosome congression forms an intermediate chromosome configuration, the prometaphase belt, which precedes biorientation. Chromosomes then invade the elongating spindle center to form the metaphase plate and start biorienting. Close to 90% of all chromosomes undergo one or more rounds of error correction of their kinetochore-microtubule attachments before achieving correct biorientation. This process depends on Aurora kinase activity.

For successful navigation and delivery, a sperm-specific calcium channel is activated in the mammalian flagellum. The genes encoding this channel (CatSpers) appear first in ancient uniflagellates, suggesting that sperm use adaptive strategies developed long ago for single-cell navigation. Here, using genetics, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and phosphoproteomics, we investigate the CatSper-dependent mechanisms underlying this flagellar switch. We find that the CatSper channel is required for four linear calcium domains that organize signaling proteins along the flagella. This unique structure focuses tyrosine phosphorylation in time and space as sperm acquire the capacity to fertilize. In heterogeneous sperm populations, we find unique molecular phenotypes, but only sperm with intact CatSper domains that organize time-dependent and spatially specific protein tyrosine phosphorylation successfully migrate. These findings illuminate flagellar adaptation, signal transduction cascade organization, and fertility.

In Bacillus spp, genes responsible for thiamin and riboflavin biosynthesis are organized in tightly controllable operons. Here, we demonstrate that the feedback regulation of riboflavin and thiamin genes relies on a novel transcription attenuation mechanism. A unique feature of this mechanism is the formation of specific complexes between a conserved leader region of the cognate RNA and FMN or TPP. In each case, the complex allows the termination hairpin to form and interrupt transcription prematurely.

These events are accompanied by mitochondrial fission that appears to require Drp1, a large GTPase of the dynamin superfamily.

Here we show that Drp1 stimulates tBid-induced Bax oligomerization and cytochrome c release by promoting tethering and hemifusion of membranes in vitro. This function of Drp1 is independent of its GTPase activity and relies on arginine 247 and the presence of cardiolipin in membranes.

We find that the centrosome protein, xCep57, localizes to kinetochores and interacts with the kinetochore proteins Zwint, Mis12, and CLIP-170. Immunodepletion of xCep57 from egg extracts yields weakened and elongated bipolar spindles which fail to align chromosomes. In the absence of xCep57, tension is lost between sister kinetochores, and spindle microtubules are no longer resistant to low doses of nocodazole. xCep57 inhibition on isolated mitotic chromosomes inhibits kinetochore-microtubule binding in vitro. xCep57 also interacts with γ-tubulin.

The underlying neuronal dynamics and brainwide interactions important for passive coping have remained unclear. Here, we develop a paradigm to study these behavioral state transitions at cellular-resolution across the entire vertebrate brain. Using brainwide imaging in zebrafish, we observed that the transition to passive coping is manifested by progressive activation of neurons in the ventral (lateral) habenula. Activation of these ventral-habenula neurons suppressed downstream neurons in the serotonergic raphe nucleus and caused behavioral passivity, whereas inhibition of these neurons prevented passivity. Data-driven recurrent neural network modeling pointed to altered intra-habenula interactions as a contributory mechanism. These results demonstrate ongoing encoding of experience features in the habenula, which guides recruitment of downstream networks and imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy.

Arterial, venous, and lymphatic ECs shared more markers in more tissues than did heterogeneous capillary ECs. ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) exhibited transcriptome similarity across tissues, but the tissue (rather than the vessel) type contributed to the EC heterogeneity. Metabolic transcriptome analysis revealed a similar tissue-grouping phenomenon of ECs and heterogeneous metabolic gene signatures in ECs between tissues and between vascular beds within a single tissue in a tissue-type-dependent pattern. The EC atlas taxonomy enabled identification of EC subclusters in public scRNA-seq datasets and provides a powerful discovery tool and resource value.",endothelial metabolism; endothelial-cell heterogeneity; mouse endothelial atlas; single-cell RNA-seq,Kalucka J.; de Rooij L.P.M.H.; Goveia J.; Rohlenova K.; Dumas S.J.; Meta E.; Conchinha N.V.; Taverna F.; Teuwen L.-A.; Veys K.; Garcia-Caballero M.; Khan S.; Geldhof V.; Sokol L.; Chen R.; Treps L.; Borri M.; de Zeeuw P.; Dubois C.; Karakach T.K.; Falkenberg K.D.; Parys M.; Yin X.; Vinckier S.; Du Y.; Fenton R.A.; Schoonjans L.; Dewerchin M.; Eelen G.; Thienpont B.; Lin L.; Bolund L.; Li X.; Luo Y.; Carmeliet P.,88.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2020,8,0.46907488,0.3537858,0.40293202,0.45414492,0.4336146,0.05646211095332221,0.6267689,0.43193197,0.05819374450113873,0.4073281,0.4452988,0.10219325587388978,0.63204545,0.22347271,0.0008549342686381967,0.3985508,0.2746392488479614,-0.020728999748826027

Here, we studied how microglia handle and cope with α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils and their clearance. We found that microglia exposed to α-syn establish a cellular network through the formation of F-actin-dependent intercellular connections, which transfer α-syn from overloaded microglia to neighboring naive microglia where the α-syn cargo got rapidly and effectively degraded. Lowering the α-syn burden attenuated the inflammatory profile of microglia and improved their survival. This degradation strategy was compromised in cells carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We confirmed the intercellular transfer of α-syn assemblies in microglia using organotypic slice cultures, 2-photon microscopy, and neuropathology of patients.

Here we report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F-BAR domain to induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I-BAR domains in vivo and in vitro. Previous work has suggested that in nonneuronal cells filopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration and the persistence of leading edge protrusions. srGAP2 knockdown reduces leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in vivo. Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain has the opposite effects, increasing leading process branching and decreasing migration. These results suggest that F-BAR domains are functionally diverse and highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the spinal cord, the organization of motor neurons into discrete clusters is linked to the location of their muscle targets, establishing a topographic map of punctate design. To define the significance of motor pool organization for neuromuscular map formation, we assessed the role of cadherin-catenin signaling in motor neuron positioning and limb muscle innervation. We find that joint inactivation of β- and γ-catenin scrambles motor neuron settling position in the spinal cord but fails to erode the predictive link between motor neuron transcriptional identity and muscle target. Inactivation of N-cadherin perturbs pool positioning in similar ways, albeit with reduced penetrance. These findings reveal that cadherin-catenin signaling directs motor pool patterning and imposes topographic order on an underlying identity-based neural map.

Specifically, the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, the founding member of the sirtuin family, contributes to clock function. Whereas SIRT1 exhibits diversity in deacetylation targets and subcellular localization, SIRT6 is the only constitutively chromatin-associated sirtuin and is prominently present at transcriptionally active genomic loci. Comparison of the hepatic circadian transcriptomes reveals that SIRT6 and SIRT1 separately control transcriptional specificity and therefore define distinctly partitioned classes of circadian genes. SIRT6 interacts with CLOCK:BMAL1 and, differently from SIRT1, governs their chromatin recruitment to circadian gene promoters. Moreover, SIRT6 controls circadian chromatin recruitment of SREBP-1, resulting in the cyclic regulation of genes implicated in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. This mechanism parallels a phenotypic disruption in fatty acid metabolism in SIRT6 null mice as revealed by circadian metabolome analyses. Thus, genomic partitioning by two independent sirtuins contributes to differential control of circadian metabolism. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Masri S.; Rigor P.; Cervantes M.; Ceglia N.; Sebastian C.; Xiao C.; Roqueta-Rivera M.; Deng C.; Osborne T.F.; Mostoslavsky R.; Baldi P.; Sassone-Corsi P.,61.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,8,0.68835205,0.56678385,0.4963717,0.7770149,0.49180222,0.09853007744051562,0.41243234,0.4598043,0.07553655354253153,0.38540953,0.36507654,0.06264920844060218,0.41045892,0.39332867,0.05509182383106537,0.6056488,0.299624502658844,0.13224180042743683

Here, we identified two Arabidopsis ankyrin-repeat proteins, STT1 and STT2, that specifically mediate sorting of chloroplast twin arginine translocation (cpTat) pathway proteins to thylakoid membranes. STT1 and STT2 form a unique hetero-dimer through interaction of their C-terminal ankyrin domains. Binding of cpTat substrate by N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions of STT complex induces liquid-liquid phase separation.

Tim21 is specific for a TIM23 form that cooperates with TOM and promotes inner membrane insertion. Protein translocation into the matrix requires a switch to a Tim21-free, PAM bound presequence translocase. Tim17 is crucial for the switch by performing two separable functions: promotion of inner membrane insertion and binding of Pam18 to form the functional TIM-PAM complex.

These results uncover an unexpected intersection between short- and long-range mechanisms of intercellular communication and reveal a pathway for GDNF signaling that does not require the RET receptor.",,Paratcha G.; Ledda F.; Ibanez C.F.,50.0,1014188.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2003,8,1.3020744,0.65586346,0.65903527,1.2881109,0.36807954,0.04791657765139751,0.5034958,0.48235393,0.09289992168323896,0.6773509,0.34165275,0.012229276044805892,0.5146515,0.4548458,0.1048964921689407,0.6773474,0.6470718383789062,0.298213928937912

How the processes of translational elongation and mRNA decay communicate is unclear. Here, we establish that the DEAD-box protein Dhh1p is a sensor of codon optimality that targets an mRNA for decay. First, we find mRNAs whose translation elongation rate is slowed by inclusion of non-optimal codons are specifically degraded in a Dhh1p-dependent manner. Biochemical experiments show Dhh1p is preferentially associated with mRNAs with suboptimal codon choice. We find these effects on mRNA decay are sensitive to the number of slow-moving ribosomes on an mRNA. Moreover, we find Dhh1p overexpression leads to the accumulation of ribosomes specifically on mRNAs (and even codons) of low codon optimality. Lastly, Dhh1p physically interacts with ribosomes in vivo. Together, these data argue that Dhh1p is a sensor for ribosome speed, targeting an mRNA for repression and subsequent decay.",,Radhakrishnan A.; Chen Y.-H.; Martin S.; Alhusaini N.; Green R.; Coller J.,69.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016,7,0.5347778,0.4129762,0.41487122,0.53126204,0.49979126,0.08778747057521841,0.46986094,0.4639858,0.07647196157617353,0.5793571,0.35120595,0.050440769433604815,0.6324635,0.39921427,0.11702100938680554,0.5383426,0.3410758376121521,-0.0506289042532444

In dissecting how this pathway integrates with the necessary downstream cytoskeletal dynamics, we discovered that GSK3β, a kinase inhibited by Wnt signaling, directly phosphorylates ACF7, a > 500 kDa microtubule-actin crosslinking protein abundant in hair follicle stem cells (HF-SCs). We map ACF7s GSK3β sites to the microtubule-binding domain and show that phosphorylation uncouples ACF7 from microtubules. Phosphorylation-refractile ACF7 rescues overall microtubule architecture, but phosphorylation-constitutive mutants do not. Neither mutant rescues polarized movement, revealing that phospho-regulation must be dynamic. This circuitry is physiologically relevant and depends upon polarized GSK3β inhibition at the migrating front of SCs/progeny streaming from HFs during wound repair. Moreover, only ACF7 and not GSKβ-refractile-ACF7 restore polarized microtubule-growth and SC-migration to ACF7 null skin.

Despite the widespread importance of zinc and proton modulation of NMDARs, the molecular mechanism by which these ions modulate receptor activity has proven elusive. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDAR in a large ensemble of conformations under a range of physiologically relevant zinc and proton concentrations.

The Toll pathway is required for the host response against fungal and most Gram-positive bacterial infections. The sensing of Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by the pattern recognition receptors PGRP-SA and GNBP1 that cooperate to detect the presence of infections in the host. Here, we report that GNBP3 is a pattern recognition receptor that is required for the detection of fungal cell wall components. Strikingly, we find that there is a second, parallel pathway acting jointly with GNBP3. The Drosophila Persephone protease activates the Toll pathway when proteolytically matured by the secreted fungal virulence factor PR1.

A cocrystal structure of an anti-K63 linkage Fab bound to K63-linked diubiquitin provides insight into the molecular basis for specificity. We use these antibodies to demonstrate that RIP1, which is essential for tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation, and IRAK1, which participates in signaling by interleukin-1β and Toll-like receptors, both undergo polyubiquitin editing in stimulated cells.

By contrast, our computer simulation based on stochastic movements of individual chromosomes predicted randomization of chromosome order in mitosis. In vivo, a quantitative assay for single chromosome positioning during mitosis revealed strong similarities between daughter and mother cells. These results demonstrate that global chromosome positions are heritable through the cell cycle in mammalian cells.

Adaptive mechanisms must fundamentally differ from homeostatic maintenance, but little is known about how physiological factors elicit tissue remodeling. Here, we show that specialized stem cell responses underlie the adaptive resizing of a mature organ. In the adult Drosophila midgut, intestinal stem cells interpret a nutrient cue to ""break homeostasis"" and drive growth when food is abundant. Activated in part by niche production of insulin, stem cells direct a growth program through two altered modes of behavior: accelerated division rates and predominance of symmetric division fates. Together, these altered modes produce a net increase in total intestinal cells, which is reversed upon withdrawal of food.

L-glutamine uptake is regulated by SLC1A5 and loss of SLC1A5 function inhibits cell growth and activates autophagy. The molecular basis for L-glutamine sensitivity is due to SLC7A5/SLC3A2, a bidirectional transporter that regulates the simultaneous efflux of L-glutamine out of cells and transport of L-leucine/EAA into cells.

These observations indicate that stabilization of homolog pairing is an active process in which the tethering of chromosome sites to the NE may be necessary but is not sufficient. ©2005 Elsevier Inc.",,Phillips C.M.; Wong C.; Bhalla N.; Carlton P.M.; Weiser P.; Meneely P.M.; Dernburg A.F.,28.0,1029976.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2005,7,0.9043131,0.64187,0.6082957,0.94779855,0.4407333,0.05220215535612277,0.5513159,0.33756137,0.037331170532647506,0.6330293,0.292161,0.049107082679177516,0.45237142,0.3749689,0.08285889901335075,0.43348807,0.6969042420387268,0.29820993542671204

Here, we generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered L1 insertions in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate retrotransposition in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1 endonuclease activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences, demonstrated that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed regions, or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the L1 endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA replication templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus, acquisition of an endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate into replicating DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed retrotransposon.

To examine the mechanisms of lifespan extension upon DR, we assayed genome-wide translational changes in Drosophila. A number of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, including those in Complex I and IV of the electron transport chain, showed increased ribosomal loading and enhanced overall activity upon DR. We found that various mitochondrial genes possessed shorter and less structured 5′UTRs, which were important for their enhanced mRNA translation. The translational repressor 4E-BP, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein, was upregulated upon DR and mediated DR dependent changes in mitochondrial activity and lifespan extension. Inhibition of individual mitochondrial subunits from Complex I and IV diminished the lifespan extension obtained upon DR, reflecting the importance of enhanced mitochondrial function during DR.

SAR establishment in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by the Lys catabolite pipecolic acid (Pip) and flavin-dependent-monooxygenase1 (FMO1). Here, we show that elevated Pip is sufficient to induce an FMO1-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of leaves that is reminiscent of SAR. In planta and in vitro analyses demonstrate that FMO1 functions as a pipecolate N-hydroxylase, catalyzing the biochemical conversion of Pip to N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). NHP systemically accumulates in plants after microbial attack. When exogenously applied, it overrides the defect of NHP-deficient fmo1 in acquired resistance and acts as a potent inducer of plant immunity to bacterial and oomycete infection. Our work has identified a pathogen-inducible L-Lys catabolic pathway in plants that generates the N-hydroxylated amino acid NHP as a critical regulator of systemic acquired resistance to pathogen infection. A pathogen-inducible L-Lys catabolic pathway in plants generates N-hydroxypipecolic acid as a critical regulator of systemic acquired resistance to pathogen infection.","Arabidopsis thaliana, pipecolic acid; FMO1; Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; N-oxygenation; NHP; plant immunity; Pseudomonas syringae, Lysine catabolism; systemic acquired resistance",Hartmann M.; Zeier T.; Bernsdorff F.; Reichel-Deland V.; Kim D.; Hohmann M.; Scholten N.; Schuck S.; Brautigam A.; Holzel T.; Ganter C.; Zeier J.,43.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2018,8,0.42503682,0.480617,0.5065101,0.5306434,0.44601166,0.05508567018743843,0.504662,0.44396937,0.03398138158721775,0.6167162,0.40147436,0.0695284118669417,0.5984758,0.2730025,-0.019307601087846904,0.364123,0.6045103073120117,0.24287950992584229

We show that, during this checkpoint response, Claspin becomes phosphorylated on threonine 906 (T906), which creates a docking site for Plx1, the Xenopus Polo-like kinase. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation of Claspin on a nearby serine (S934) by Plx1. After a prolonged interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg extracts typically undergo adaptation and enter into mitosis despite the presence of incompletely replicated DNA. In this process, Claspin dissociates from chromatin, and Chk1 undergoes inactivation. By contrast, aphidicolin-treated extracts containing mutants of Claspin with alanine substitutions at positions 906 or 934 (T906A or S934A) are unable to undergo adaptation. Under such adaptation-defective conditions, Claspin accumulates on chromatin at high levels, and Chk1 does not decrease in activity.

Here, we identify a class of compounds derived from dietary, microbial, and industrial sources that are characterized by the presence of a five-membered oxazole ring and induce CD1d-dependent intestinal inflammation. We observe that minimal oxazole structures modulate natural killer T cell-dependent inflammation by regulating lipid antigen presentation by CD1d on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). CD1d-restricted production of interleukin 10 by IECs is limited through activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway in response to oxazole induction of tryptophan metabolites. As such, the depletion of the AhR in the intestinal epithelium abrogates oxazole-induced inflammation. In summary, we identify environmentally derived oxazoles as triggers of CD1d-dependent intestinal inflammatory responses that occur via activation of the AhR in the intestinal epithelium. A class of microbial and environmental compounds triggers inflammation in gut epithelial cells through the action of natural killer T cells and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling.","aryl hydrocarbon receptor; CD1d; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal epithelial cell; microbiota; microcin; mucosal inflammation; natural killer T cell; oxazole; tryptophan",Iyer S.S.; Gensollen T.; Gandhi A.; Oh S.F.; Neves J.F.; Collin F.; Lavin R.; Serra C.; Glickman J.; de Silva P.S.A.; Sartor R.B.; Besra G.; Hauser R.; Maxwell A.; Llebaria A.; Blumberg R.S.,47.0,733248057.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2018,8,0.62645745,0.5512501,0.46659908,0.5729415,0.43171,0.05150262285032997,0.6521123,0.46441007,0.0663149096774096,0.62382424,0.4149928,0.04501880305031564,0.66855043,0.3004912,-0.01376690693843119,0.6752479,0.4352276921272278,0.246451735496521

The mechanism by which the Sm proteins are gathered while preventing illicit Sm assembly on non-snRNAs is unknown. Here, we describe the 2.5 crystal structure of Gemin2 bound to SmD1/D2/F/E/G pentamer and SMN's Gemin2-binding domain, a key assembly intermediate. Remarkably, through its extended conformation, Gemin2 wraps around the crescent-shaped pentamer, interacting with all five Sm proteins, and gripping its bottom and top sides and outer perimeter. Gemin2 reaches into the RNA-binding pocket, preventing RNA binding. Interestingly, SMN-Gemin2 interaction is abrogated by a spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-causing mutation in an SMN helix that mediates Gemin2 binding.

We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions.

By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.",epithelial-mesenchymal interactions; lineage determination; single-cell analyses; stem cells; tissue regeneration,Yang H.; Adam R.C.; Ge Y.; Hua Z.L.; Fuchs E.,51.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2017,8,0.7196254,0.44256943,0.45275712,0.6536461,0.37037385,0.03722945715761189,0.5948941,0.49915767,0.08573629398296895,0.56387997,0.420689,0.08994530404967227,0.5210801,0.36428416,0.047705371198154656,0.33431953,0.19267377257347107,-0.2929576337337494

Here, we describe the regulatory mechanism of this transition. We show that miR156 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of the juvenile phase, and regulates the timing of the juvenile-to-adult transition by coordinating the expression of several pathways that control different aspects of this process. miR156 acts by repressing the expression of functionally distinct SPL transcription factors. miR172 acts downstream of miR156 to promote adult epidermal identity. miR156 regulates the expression of miR172 via SPL9 which, redundantly with SPL10, directly promotes the transcription of miR172b. Thus, like the larval-to-adult transition in Caenorhabditis elegans, the juvenile-to-adult transition in Arabidopsis is mediated by sequentially operating miRNAs. miR156 and miR172 are positively regulated by the transcription factors they target, suggesting that negative feedback loops contribute to the stability of the juvenile and adult phases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We construct a molecular model of the COPII cage by fitting Sec13/31 crystal structures into a recently determined electron microscopy density map. The vertex geometry involves four copies of the Sec31 β-propeller that converge through their axial ends; there is no interdigitation of assembly units of the kind seen in clathrin cages.

A simple mechanical model has been proposed to explain this observation, in which too little adhesion does not provide sufficient traction whereas too much adhesion renders cells immobile. Here we characterize a phenotype for rapid cell migration, which in contrast to the previous model reveals a complex interdependence of subcellular systems that mediates optimal cell migration in response to increasing adhesion strength. The organization and activity of actin, myosin II, and focal adhesions (FAs) are spatially and temporally highly variable and do not exhibit a simple correlation with optimal motility rates. Furthermore, we can recapitulate rapid migration at a nonoptimal ECM concentration by manipulating myosin II activity.

Repression of dClock by VRI is separated from activation by PDP1 since VRI levels peak 3-6 hours before PDP1. Rhythmic vri transcription is required for molecular rhythms, and here we show that the clock stops in a Pdp1 null mutant, identifying Pdp1 as an essential clock gene.

This structural similarity suggests that DksA coiled coil protrudes into the RNAP secondary channel to coordinate a ppGpp bound Mg2+ ion with the Asp residues, thereby stabilizing the ppGpp-RNAP complex. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that DksA affects transcript elongation, albeit differently from GreA; augments ppGpp effects on initiation; and binds directly to RNAP, positioning the Asp residues near the active site.

Our findings demonstrate that two fundamentally distinct roles of context in fear memory retrieval are processed by distinct vHC output pathways, thereby allowing for the formation of robust contextual fear memories while preserving context-dependent behavioral flexibility.",basal amygdala; basal amygdala; central amygdala; contextual fear; fear conditioning; fear renewal; optogenetics; rabies-ArchT; trans-synaptic tracing; ventral hippocampus,Xu C.; Krabbe S.; Grundemann J.; Botta P.; Fadok J.P.; Osakada F.; Saur D.; Grewe B.F.; Schnitzer M.J.; Callaway E.M.; Luthi A.,67.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.5347778,0.4129762,0.41487122,0.53126204,0.441756,0.05898677092420024,0.5321195,0.47297573,0.033927988392134845,0.6766062,0.44753718,0.10134417566785031,0.4983197,0.35535848,0.02225914141356261,0.32437545,0.0010532103478908539,-0.6412907838821411

Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs.

Unexpectedly, we uncover a profound disruption of the circadian clock and diurnal transcriptome when hypoxic cells are permitted to acidify to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Buffering against acidification or inhibiting lactic acid production fully rescues circadian oscillation. Acidification of several human and murine cell lines, as well as primary murine T cells, suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, a key regulator of translation in response to metabolic status. We find that acid drives peripheral redistribution of normally perinuclear lysosomes away from perinuclear RHEB, thereby inhibiting the activity of lysosome-bound mTOR. Restoring mTORC1 signaling and the translation it governs rescues clock oscillation. Our findings thus reveal a model in which acid produced during the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia suppresses the circadian clock through diminished translation of clock constituents. Acid drives the redistribution of lysosomes to cellular peripheries, thus separating lysosomal mTORC1 from its perinuclear activator RHEB and leading to a collapse of the circadian clock.",acidity; cancer; circadian; clock; hypoxia; hypoxia-inducible factor; lysosome; mTOR; pH; RHEB,Walton Z.E.; Patel C.H.; Brooks R.C.; Yu Y.; Ibrahim-Hashim A.; Riddle M.; Porcu A.; Jiang T.; Ecker B.L.; Tameire F.; Koumenis C.; Weeraratna A.T.; Welsh D.K.; Gillies R.; Alwine J.C.; Zhang L.; Powell J.D.; Dang C.V.,53.0,733326016.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2018,8,0.6624298,0.49285287,0.50349236,0.70131284,0.4288665,0.04431949787067779,0.53817576,0.5046286,0.08651098223411002,0.4249239,0.46165538,0.10297951737960603,0.6109385,0.37336743,0.04626552320278671,0.55524594,0.4261974096298218,0.1833401322364807

Exit from prophase I is controlled by the recombination checkpoint (RC), which, in yeast, represses the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 required for the expression of B-type cyclins and other M phase regulators. We show that an extended prophase I additionally requires the suppression of latent, mitotic cell-cycle controls by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its meiosis-specific activator Ama1, which trigger the degradation of M phase regulators and Ndd1, a subunit of a mitotic transcription factor. ama1Δ mutants exit from prophase I prematurely and independently of the RC, which results in recombination defects and chromosome missegregation.

To determine the parental contributions and their regulation during Arabidopsis embryogenesis, we combined deep-sequencing-based RNA profiling and genetic analyses. At the 2-4 cell stage there is a strong, genome-wide dominance of maternal transcripts, although transcripts are contributed by both parental genomes. At the globular stage the relative paternal contribution is higher, largely due to a gradual activation of the paternal genome. We identified two antagonistic maternal pathways that control these parental contributions. Paternal alleles are initially downregulated by the chromatin siRNA pathway, linked to DNA and histone methylation, whereas transcriptional activation requires maternal activity of the histone chaperone complex CAF1.

Although multiple RBPs have been implicated in transcription control, it has remained unclear how extensively RBPs directly act on chromatin. We embarked on a large-scale RBP ChIP-seq analysis, revealing widespread RBP presence in active chromatin regions in the human genome. Like transcription factors (TFs), RBPs also show strong preference for hotspots in the genome, particularly gene promoters, where their association is frequently linked to transcriptional output. Unsupervised clustering reveals extensive co-association between TFs and RBPs, as exemplified by YY1, a known RNA-dependent TF, and RBM25, an RBP involved in splicing regulation. Remarkably, RBM25 depletion attenuates all YY1-dependent activities, including chromatin binding, DNA looping, and transcription. We propose that various RBPs may enhance network interaction through harnessing regulatory RNAs to control transcription.

Elegans by employing catalytic slicing activity to broadly tune, instead of silence, germline gene expression. Misregulation of one target, a kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase, underlies a major phenotype associated with pathway loss. Tuning of target transcript levels is guided by the density of homologous small RNAs, whose generation must ultimately be related to target sequence. Thus, the tuning action of a small RNA-catalytic Argonaute pathway generates oocytes capable of supporting embryogenesis.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which PP2A activity is inhibited in human cancers are currently unclear. In this study, we describe a cellular inhibitor of PP2A with oncogenic activity. The protein, designated Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), interacts directly with the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, inhibits PP2A activity toward c-Myc serine 62 (S62), and thereby prevents c-Myc proteolytic degradation. In addition to its function in c-Myc stabilization, CIP2A promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. The oncogenic activity of CIP2A is demonstrated by transformation of human cells by overexpression of CIP2A. Importantly, CIP2A is overexpressed in two common human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colon cancer. Thus, our data show that CIP2A is a human oncoprotein that inhibits PP2A and stabilizes c-Myc in human malignancies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

During microRNA biogenesis, Drosha and Dicer process the primary transcript (pri-miRNA) through a precursor hairpin (pre-miRNA) to the mature miRNA. The miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) with Argonaute proteins, the effector molecules in RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we show that all Argonautes elevate mature miRNA expression posttranscriptionally, independent of RNase activity. Also, we identify a role for the RISC slicer Argonaute2 (Ago2) in cleaving the pre-miRNA to an additional processing intermediate, termed Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNA or ac-pre-miRNA. This endogenous, on-pathway intermediate results from cleavage of the pre-miRNA hairpin 12 nucleotides from its 3′-end. By analogy to siRNA processing, Ago2 cleavage may facilitate removal of the nicked passenger strand from RISC after maturation.

We have identified the sorting signal of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins that is universal in all eukaryotic kingdoms. The β-signal initiates precursor insertion into a hydrophilic, proteinaceous membrane environment by forming a ternary complex with Sam35 and Sam50. Sam35 recognizes the β-signal, inducing a major conductance increase of the Sam50 channel. Subsequent precursor release from SAM is coupled to integration into the lipid phase.

Here, we show roles for the Gαo subunit (Go) in mediating the two distinct pathways transduced by Fz receptors in Drosophila: the Wnt and planar polarity pathways. Go is required for transduction of both pathways, and epistasis experiments suggest that it is an immediate transducer of Fz. While overexpression effects of the wild-type form are receptor dependent, the activated form (Go-GTP) can signal when the receptor is removed.

We find that progesterone-receptor (PR)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) are active and required during this behavior. Activating these neurons, however, does not elicit sexual behavior in non-estrus females. We show that projections of PR+ VMH neurons to the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nucleus change across the 5-day mouse estrous cycle, with ∼3-fold more termini and functional connections during estrus. This cyclic increase in connectivity is found in adult females, but not males, and regulated by estrogen signaling in PR+ VMH neurons. We further show that these connections are essential for sexual behavior in receptive females. Thus, estrogen-regulated structural plasticity of behaviorally salient connections in the adult female brain links sexual behavior to the estrus phase of the estrous cycle.","anteroventral periventricular nucleus; emotional behavior; estrogen, progesterone; estrous cycle; plasticity; sexual behavior; sexually dimorphic behavior; ventromedial hypothalamus",Inoue S.; Yang R.; Tantry A.; Davis C.-H.; Yang T.; Knoedler J.R.; Wei Y.; Adams E.L.; Thombare S.; Golf S.R.; Neve R.L.; Tessier-Lavigne M.; Ding J.B.; Shah N.M.,91.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,8,0.51821196,0.42055073,0.41086936,0.52180487,0.37603343,0.02876720135538796,0.28740865,0.42460644,0.0664359723783472,0.3789909,0.26680088,0.06263642653675472,0.47877946,0.21463668,-0.008870899310978841,0.53361326,-0.4977808892726898,-0.45079338550567627

The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5′-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (“cap-snatching”). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could generate chimeric human-viral mRNAs with coding potential. We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named “start-snatching.” Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral “untranslated regions” (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we show that in liver the activity of PARP-1, an NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase, oscillates in a daily manner and is regulated by feeding. We provide biochemical evidence that PARP-1 binds and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates CLOCK at the beginning of the light phase. The loss of PARP-1 enhances the binding of CLOCK-BMAL1 to DNA and leads to a phase-shift of the interaction of CLOCK-BMAL1 with PER and CRY repressor proteins. As a consequence, CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent gene expression is altered in PARP-1-deficient mice, in particular in response to changes in feeding times. Our results show that Parp-1 knockout mice exhibit impaired food entrainment of peripheral circadian clocks and support a role for PARP-1 in connecting feeding with the mammalian timing system.

Ago2 is the catalytic component of the RNAi enzyme complex, RISC. For each siRNA duplex, only one strand, the guide, is assembled into the active RISC; the other strand, the passenger, is destroyed. An ATP-dependent helicase has been proposed first to separate the two siRNA strands, then the resulting single-stranded guide is thought to bind Ago2. Here, we show that Ago2 instead directly receives the double-stranded siRNA from the RISC assembly machinery. Ago2 then cleaves the siRNA passenger strand, thereby liberating the single-stranded guide. For siRNAs, virtually all RISC is assembled through this cleavage-assisted mechanism. In contrast, passenger-strand cleavage is not important for the incorporation of miRNAs that derive from mismatched duplexes.

The molecular mechanisms underlying nonhost immunity in plants remain obscure. In Arabidopsis, nonhost/nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae sustains but pathogenic P. syringae suppresses early MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) marker-gene activation. We performed a cell-based genetic screen of virulence factors and identified AvrPto and AvrPtoB as potent and unique suppressors of early-defense gene transcription and MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling. Unlike effectors of mammalian pathogens, AvrPto and AvrPtoB intercept multiple MAMP-mediated signaling upstream of MAPKKK at the plasma membrane linked to the receptor. In transgenic Arabidopsis, AvrPto blocks early MAMP signaling and enables nonhost P. syringae growth. Deletions of avrPto and avrPtoB from pathogenic P. syringae reduce its virulence.

The influence of myosin activity on Yorkie depends genetically on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub, a negative regulator of Warts within the Hippo pathway.

Two major complexes, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), are thought to mediate PcG-dependent repression in flies and mammals. In Drosophila, PcG/trxG protein complexes are recruited by PcG/trxG response elements (PREs). However, it has been unclear how PcG/trxG are recuited in vertebrates. Here we have identified a vertebrate PRE, PRE-kr, that regulates expression of the mouse MafB/Kreisler gene. PRE-kr recruits PcG proteins in flies and mouse F9 cells and represses gene expression in a PcG/trxG-dependent manner. PRC1 and 2 bind to a minimal PRE-kr region, which can recruit stable PRC1 binding but only weak PRC2 binding when introduced ectopically, suggesting that PRC1 and 2 have different binding requirements. Thus, we provide evidence that similar to invertebrates, PREs act as entry sites for PcG/trxG chromatin remodeling in vertebrates. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that transbilayer interactions are necessary for the generation of cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters of GPI-anchored proteins mediated by membrane-adjacent dynamic actin filaments. We find that long saturated acyl-chains are required for forming GPI-anchor nanoclusters. Simultaneously, at the inner leaflet, long acyl-chain-containing phosphatidylserine (PS) is necessary for transbilayer coupling. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric multicomponent-membrane bilayers in a mixed phase provide evidence that immobilization of long saturated acyl-chain lipids at either leaflet stabilizes cholesterol-dependent transbilayer interactions forming local domains with characteristics similar to a liquid-ordered (lo) phase. This is verified by experiments wherein immobilization of long acyl-chain lipids at one leaflet effects transbilayer interactions of corresponding lipids at the opposite leaflet.

Here, we describe a further nucleator, cordon-bleu (Cobl). Cobl is a brain-enriched protein using three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domains for actin binding. Cobl promotes nonbundled, unbranched filaments. Filament formation relies on barbed-end growth and requires all three Cobl WH2 domains and the extended linker L2. We suggest that the nucleation power of Cobl is based on the assembly of three actin monomers in cross-filament orientation. Cobl localizes to sites of high actin dynamics and modulates cell morphology. In neurons, induction of both neurites and neurite branching is dramatically increased by Cobl expression-effects that critically depend on Cobl's actin nucleation ability. Correspondingly, Cobl depletion results in decreased dendritic arborization. Thus, Cobl is an actin nucleator controlling neuronal morphology and development. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed the role of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPRER) in aging of C. elegans and found that age-onset loss of ER proteostasis could be reversed by expression of a constitutively active form of XBP-1, XBP-1s. Neuronally derived XBP-1s was sufficient to rescue stress resistance, increase longevity, and activate the UPRER in distal, non-neuronal cell types through a cell-nonautonomous mechanism. Loss of UPR ER signaling components in distal cells blocked cell-nonautonomous signaling from the nervous system, thereby blocking increased longevity of the entire animal. Reduction of small clear vesicle (SCV) release blocked nonautonomous signaling downstream of xbp-1s, suggesting that the release of neurotransmitters is required for this intertissue signaling event. Our findings point toward a secreted ER stress signal (SERSS) that promotes ER stress resistance and longevity.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of most PN classes and unequivocally mapped transcriptomes to specific olfactory function for six classes. Transcriptomes of closely related PN classes exhibit the largest differences during circuit assembly but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed genes between classes and are highly informative in encoding cell identity, enabling us to identify a new lineage-specific transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting.

For example, the cytokine IL-2 can promote proliferation and death of T cells. The role of such paradoxical signaling remains unclear. To address this, we studied CD4+ T cell expansion in culture. We found that cells with a 30-fold difference in initial concentrations reached a homeostatic concentration nearly independent of initial cell levels. Below an initial threshold, cell density decayed to extinction (OFF-state). We show that these dynamics relate to the paradoxical effect of IL-2, which increases the proliferation rate cooperatively and the death rate linearly. Mathematical modeling explained the observed cell and cytokine dynamics and predicted conditions that shifted cell fate from homeostasis to the OFF-state. We suggest that paradoxical signaling provides cell circuits with specific dynamical features that are robust to environmental perturbations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Hart Y.; Reich-Zeliger S.; Antebi Y.E.; Zaretsky I.; Mayo A.E.; Alon U.; Friedman N.,46.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,7,0.23901737,0.3613618,0.3439443,0.2858487,0.42514765,0.07751515104779566,0.6045413,0.4496684,0.0703477373586891,0.48909253,0.45804524,0.08372525028341321,0.5740957,0.43185818,0.11060122655604543,0.6544759,0.529992938041687,0.199137344956398

The action of telomerase at the telomere terminus is regulated by opposing activities that either recruit/activate the enzyme at shorter telomeres or inhibit it at longer ones, thus achieving a stable average telomere length. To elucidate the mechanistic details of telomerase regulation we engineered specific chromosome ends in yeast so that a single telomere could be suddenly shortened and, as a consequence of its reduced length, elongated by telomerase. We show that shortened telomeres replicate early in S phase, unlike normal-length telomeres, due to the early firing of origins of DNA replication in subtelomeric regions. Early telomere replication correlates with increased telomere length and telomerase activity. These data reveal an epigenetic effect of telomere length on the activity of nearby replication origins and an unanticipated link between telomere replication timing and telomerase action. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Dnmt3L is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but its function in these cells is unknown. Through genome-wide analysis of Dnmt3L knockdown in ESCs, we found that Dnmt3L is a positive regulator of methylation at the gene bodies of housekeeping genes and, more surprisingly, is also a negative regulator of methylation at promoters of bivalent genes. Dnmt3L is required for the differentiation of ESCs into primordial germ cells (PGCs) through the activation of the homeotic gene Rhox5. We demonstrate that Dnmt3L interacts with the Polycomb PRC2 complex in competition with the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to maintain low methylation levels at the H3K27me3 regions.

However, two people inheriting the same mutation often have different severity of symptoms, and this is partly genetic. The effects of genetic background on mutant phenotypes are poorly understood, but predicting them is critical for personalized medicine. To study this phenomenon comprehensively and systematically, we used RNAi to compare loss-of-function phenotypes for ∼1,400 genes in two isolates of C. elegans and find that ∼20% of genes differ in the severity of phenotypes in these two genetic backgrounds. Crucially, this effect of genetic background on the severity of both RNAi and mutant phenotypes can be predicted from variation in the expression levels of the affected gene.

DSCAM and DCC can each mediate a turning response of these neurons to netrin-1. Similarly, Xenopus spinal neurons exogenously expressing DSCAM can be attracted by netrin-1 independently of DCC.

Stx17 localizes to the outer membrane of completed autophagosomes but not to the isolation membrane (unclosed intermediate structures); for this reason, the lysosome does not fuse with the isolation membrane. Stx17 interacts with SNAP-29 and the endosomal/lysosomal SNARE VAMP8. Depletion of Stx17 causes accumulation of autophagosomes without degradation. Stx17 has a unique C-terminal hairpin structure mediated by two tandem transmembrane domains containing glycine zipper-like motifs, which is essential for its association with the autophagosomal membrane.

A sensitive assay for competitive binding of dinucleosome substrates revealed that SWR1 preferentially binds long nucleosome-free DNA and the adjoining nucleosome core particle, allowing discrimination of gene promoters over gene bodies. Analysis of mutants indicates that the conserved Swc2/YL1 subunit and the adenosine triphosphatase domain of Swr1 are mainly responsible for binding to substrate. SWR1 binding is enhanced on nucleosomes acetylated by the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase, but recognition of nucleosome-free and nucleosomal DNA is dominant over interaction with acetylated histones.

Here, we uncover a sexually dimorphic role of the medial amygdala (MeA) in governing parental and infanticidal behaviors. Contrary to traditional views, activation of GABAergic neurons in the MeA promotes parental behavior in females, while activation of this population in males differentially promotes parental versus infanticidal behavior in an activity-level-dependent manner. Through single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we found that molecular sex differences in the MeA are specifically represented in GABAergic neurons. Collectively, these results establish crucial roles for the MeA as a key node in the neural circuitry underlying pup-directed behaviors and provide important insight into the connection between sex differences across transcriptomes, cells, and circuits in regulating sexually dimorphic behavior.

Most accounts of how the brain performs this process of temporal integration have focused on evolving patterns of spiking activity.

Photobleaching experiments in living cells indicate that receptors transiently interact with DNA on the time scale of seconds and predict that the response elements may be sparsely occupied on average. Here, we show that the binding of one receptor at the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) does not reduce the steady-state binding of another receptor variant to the same GRE. Mathematical simulations reproduce this noncompetitive state using short GR/GRE residency times and relatively long times between DNA binding events. At many genomic sites where GR binding causes increased chromatin accessibility, concurrent steady-state binding levels for the variant receptor are actually increased, a phenomenon termed assisted loading. Temporally sparse transcription factor-DNA interactions induce local chromatin reorganization, resulting in transient access for binding of secondary regulatory factors.

Sequence analysis suggests that prion-like proteins are prevalent in various species; however, it remains unclear what functional space they occupy in multicellular organisms. Here, we report the identification of a prion-like protein, Herzog (CG5830), through a multimodal screen in Drosophila melanogaster. Herzog functions as a membrane-associated phosphatase and controls embryonic patterning, likely being involved in TGF-β/BMP and FGF/EGF signaling pathways. Remarkably, monomeric Herzog is enzymatically inactive and becomes active upon amyloid-like assembly. The prion-like domain of Herzog is necessary for both its assembly and membrane targeting. Removal of the prion-like domain impairs activity, while restoring assembly on the membrane using a heterologous prion-like domain and membrane-targeting motif can restore phosphatase activity.

Strikingly, each selector sequence is complementary to a portion of the docking site, and this pairing juxtaposes one, and only one, alternative exon to the upstream constitutive exon.

As a result, investigation of the potential role of extracellular tyrosine phosphorylation in physiological and pathological tissue regulation has not been possible. Here, we show that VLK, a putative protein kinase previously shown to be essential in embryonic development, is a secreted protein kinase, with preference for tyrosine, that phosphorylates a broad range of secreted and ER-resident substrate proteins. We find that VLK is rapidly and quantitatively secreted from platelets in response to stimuli and can tyrosine phosphorylate coreleased proteins utilizing endogenous as well as exogenous ATP sources. We propose that discovery of VLK activity provides an explanation for the extensive and conserved pattern of extracellular tyrosine phosphophorylation seen in vivo, and extends the importance of regulated tyrosine phosphorylation into the extracellular environment.

Although this process is known to be regulated by follicular helper T (TfH) cells, the mechanism by which B cells initially seed germinal center reactions remains elusive. We found that NKT cells, a population of innate-like T lymphocytes, are critical for the induction of B cell immunity upon viral infection. The positioning of NKT cells at the interfollicular areas of lymph nodes facilitates both their direct priming by resident macrophages and the localized delivery of innate signals to antigen-experienced B cells. Indeed, NKT cells secrete an early wave of IL-4 and constitute up to 70% of the total IL-4-producing cells during the initial stages of infection. Importantly, the requirement of this innate immunity arm appears to be evolutionarily conserved because early NKT and IL-4 gene signatures also positively correlate with the levels of neutralizing antibodies in Zika-virus-infected macaques. In conclusion, our data support a model wherein a pre-TfH wave of IL-4 secreted by interfollicular NKT cells triggers the seeding of germinal center cells and serves as an innate link between viral infection and B cell immunity.

The ubiquitination of RNAPIIo in response to DNA damage is an evolutionarily conserved event, but its function in mammals is unknown. Here, we identified a single DNA damage-induced ubiquitination site in RNAPII at RPB1-K1268, which regulates transcription recovery and DNA damage resistance. Mechanistically, RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination stimulates the association of the core-TFIIH complex with stalled RNAPIIo through a transfer mechanism that also involves UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination. We developed a strand-specific ChIP-seq method, which revealed RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is important for repair and the resolution of transcriptional bottlenecks at DNA lesions. Finally, RPB1-K1268R knockin mice displayed a short life-span, premature aging, and neurodegeneration.

Cohesion and condensation require the SMC complexes, cohesin and condensin, respectively. Here we use budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that condensin and Cdc5, a Polo-like kinase, facilitate the removal of cohesin from chromosomes prior to the onset of anaphase I when homologs segregate. This cohesin removal is critical for homolog segregation because it helps dissolve the recombination-dependent links between homologs that form during prophase I. Condensin enhances the association of Cdc5 with chromosomes and its phosphorylation of cohesin, which in turn likely stimulates cohesin removal.

Numb signaling specifies progenitor over neuronal fates but, paradoxically, also promotes neuronal differentiation. Here we report that ACBD3 is a Numb partner in cell-fate specification. ACBD3 and Numb proteins interact through an essential Numb domain, and the respective loss- and gain-of-function mutant mice share phenotypic similarities. Interestingly, ACBD3 associates with the Golgi apparatus in neurons and interphase progenitor cells but becomes cytosolic after Golgi fragmentation during mitosis, when Numb activity is needed to distinguish the two daughter cells. Accordingly, cytosolic ACBD3 can act synergistically with Numb to specify cell fates, and its continuing presence during the progenitor cell cycle inhibits neuron production. We propose that Golgi fragmentation and reconstitution during cell cycle differentially regulate Numb signaling through changes in ACBD3 subcellular distribution and represent a mechanism for coupling cell-fate specification and cell-cycle progression. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The cotranslational mixed-disulfide intermediate is, upon further chain elongation, resolved, releasing the oxidized polypeptide, thus allowing us to follow the folding process. This analysis reveals that two cysteines that are joined to form a structural disulfide can play different roles during the folding reaction and that the mode of translocation (cotranslational verse posttranslational) can affect the folding process of a protein in the periplasm.

However, in organ failure, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD), itch becomes chronic, intractable, and debilitating. In addition to chronic itch, patients often experience intense acute itch exacerbations. Recent discoveries have unearthed the neuroimmune circuitry of itch, leading to the development of anti-itch treatments. However, mechanisms underlying acute itch exacerbations remain overlooked. Herein, we identify that a large proportion of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and exhibit a propensity for acute itch flares. In mice, while allergen-provoked acute itch is mediated by the mast cell-histamine axis in steady state, AD-associated inflammation renders this pathway dispensable.

Isolated JARID1B-positive melanoma cells give rise to a highly proliferative progeny. Knockdown of JARID1B leads to an initial acceleration of tumor growth followed by exhaustion which suggests that the JARID1B-positive subpopulation is essential for continuous tumor growth. Expression of JARID1B is dynamically regulated and does not follow a hierarchical cancer stem cell model because JARID1B-negative cells can become positive and even single melanoma cells irrespective of selection are tumorigenic.

To further evaluate the different tumor microenvironments, we injected mice with prostate tumor cells either subcutaneously or intraosseously.

Using real-time single-molecule analysis, we establish that leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases function independently within a single replisome. Although average rates of DNA synthesis on leading and lagging strands are similar, individual trajectories of both DNA polymerases display stochastically switchable rates of synthesis interspersed with distinct pauses. DNA unwinding by the replicative helicase may continue during such pauses, but a self-governing mechanism, where helicase speed is reduced by ∼80%, permits recoupling of polymerase to helicase. These features imply a more dynamic, kinetically discontinuous replication process, wherein contacts within the replisome are continually broken and reformed. We conclude that the stochastic behavior of replisome components ensures complete DNA duplication without requiring coordination of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis.

Little is known about the mechanism governing the sequential developmental process that leads to integration of new neurons from adult neural stem cells into the existing circuitry. Here, we investigated roles of Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Unexpectedly, downregulation of DISC1 leads to accelerated neuronal integration, resulting in aberrant morphological development and mispositioning of new dentate granule cells in a cell-autonomous fashion. Functionally, newborn neurons with DISC1 knockdown exhibit enhanced excitability and accelerated dendritic development and synapse formation.

CRISPR interference of PVT1 promoter enhances breast cancer cell competition and growth in vivo. The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition. Cancer genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations encompassing the human PVT1 promoter, and genome editing verified that PVT1 promoter mutation promotes cancer cell growth.

By contrast, non-enzymatic filament crosslinkers are regarded as mere friction-generating entities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that diffusible microtubule crosslinkers of the Ase1/PRC1/Map65 family generate directed microtubule sliding when confined between partially overlapping microtubules. The Ase1-generated forces, directly measured by optical tweezers to be in the piconewton-range, were sufficient to antagonize motor-protein driven microtubule sliding. Force generation is quantitatively explained by the entropic expansion of confined Ase1 molecules diffusing within the microtubule overlaps. The thermal motion of crosslinkers is thus harnessed to generate mechanical work analogous to compressed gas propelling a piston in a cylinder.

We find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary timescales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions.

Here, we show that MHC-I selectively accumulate within phagosomes carrying microbial components, which engage Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Although cross-presentation requires Sec22b-mediated phagosomal recruitment of the peptide loading complex from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), this step is independent of TLR signaling and does not deliver MHC-I. Instead, MHC-I are recruited from an endosomal recycling compartment (ERC), which is marked by Rab11a, VAMP3/cellubrevin, and VAMP8/endobrevin and holds large reserves of MHC-I.

We explore properties of this cis-regulatory change, revealing the role of particular retroelements, uncovering broad clusters of species-biased enhancers near genes associated with human facial variation, and demonstrating that cis-regulatory divergence is linked to quantitative expression differences of crucial neural crest regulators.

We found an association of the aggressive PCa-associated allele G of rs11672691 with elevated transcript levels of two biologically plausible candidate genes, PCAT19 and CEACAM21, implicated in PCa cell growth and tumor progression.

Because the “survival of motor neuron protein” (SMN) is implicated in the formation of three different membraneless organelles (MLOs), we hypothesized that SMN promotes condensation. Unexpectedly, we found that SMN's globular tudor domain was sufficient for dimerization-induced condensation in vivo, whereas its two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were not. Binding to dimethylarginine (DMA) modified protein ligands was required for condensate formation by the tudor domains in SMN and at least seven other fly and human proteins. Remarkably, asymmetric versus symmetric DMA determined whether two distinct nuclear MLOs—gems and Cajal bodies—were separate or “docked” to one another.

We show that Osa induces a transcriptional program in the transit-amplifying population that initiates temporal patterning, limits self-renewal, and prevents dedifferentiation. We identify the Prdm protein Hamlet as a key component of this program. Hamlet is directly induced by Osa and regulates the progression of progenitors through distinct transcriptional states to limit the number of transit-amplifying divisions.

Historically, the ancestry of modern Ugandans was best represented by a mixture of ancient East African pastoralists. We demonstrate the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as an imputation resource. Examining 34 cardiometabolic traits, we show systematic differences in trait heritability between European and African populations, probably reflecting the differential impact of genes and environment. In a multi-trait pan-African GWAS of up to 14,126 individuals, we identify novel loci associated with anthropometric, hematological, lipid, and glycemic traits. We find that several functionally important signals are driven by Africa-specific variants, highlighting the value of studying diverse populations across the region. Genome-wide data from Ugandans reveal insights into their ancestry, trait heritability, and loci associated with metabolic parameters, thereby providing a diverse resource for the study of African population genetics.",,Gurdasani D.; Carstensen T.; Fatumo S.; Chen G.; Franklin C.S.; Prado-Martinez J.; Bouman H.; Abascal F.; Haber M.; Tachmazidou I.; Mathieson I.; Ekoru K.; DeGorter M.K.; Nsubuga R.N.; Finan C.; Wheeler E.; Chen L.; Cooper D.N.; Schiffels S.; Chen Y.; Ritchie G.R.S.; Pollard M.O.; Fortune M.D.; Mentzer A.J.; Garrison E.; Bergstrom A.; Hatzikotoulas K.; Adeyemo A.; Doumatey A.; Elding H.; Wain L.V.; Ehret G.; Auer P.L.; Kooperberg C.L.; Reiner A.P.; Franceschini N.; Maher D.P.; Montgomery S.B.; Kadie C.; Widmer C.; Xue Y.; Seeley J.; Asiki G.; Kamali A.; Young E.H.; Pomilla C.; Soranzo N.; Zeggini E.; Pirie F.; Morris A.P.; Heckerman D.; Tyler-Smith C.; Motala A.; Rotimi C.; Kaleebu P.; Barroso I.; Sandhu M.S.,139.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,7,0.399357,0.47316873,0.4491469,0.37321612,0.42756963,0.02709282414619063,0.24309213,0.44248533,0.03629037939906382,0.43756446,0.18634188,0.04872750317319113,0.63365215,0.011067152,-0.06387790144345762,0.31068736,-0.5065211653709412,-0.8675147294998169

Crystallographic studies have shown how ligand binding induces dimerization of the EGFR extracellular region but cannot explain the ""high-affinity"" and ""low-affinity"" classes of cell-surface EGF-binding sites inferred from curved Scatchard plots. From a series of crystal structures of the Drosophila EGFR extracellular region, we show here how Scatchard plot curvature arises from negatively cooperative ligand binding. The first ligand-binding event induces formation of an asymmetric dimer with only one bound ligand. The unoccupied site in this dimer is structurally restrained, leading to reduced affinity for binding of the second ligand, and thus negative cooperativity. Our results explain the cell-surface binding characteristics of EGF receptors and suggest how individual EGFR ligands might stabilize distinct dimeric species with different signaling properties.

These animals developed obesity on a high-fat diet, with severe insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. They also showed altered fat distribution with markedly increased subcutaneous adiposity. Subcutaneous adipose tissue in mutant mice acquired many key properties of visceral fat, including decreased thermogenic and increased inflammatory gene expression and increased macrophage accumulation. Transplantation of subcutaneous fat into mice with diet-induced obesity showed a loss of metabolic benefit when tissues were derived from PRDM16 mutant animals.

The protein PIE-1 represses transcription in the later germline blastomeres but not in the earlier germline blastomeres P0 and P1. We show here that OMA-1 and OMA-2, previously shown to regulate oocyte maturation, repress transcription in P0 and P1 by binding to and sequestering in the cytoplasm TAF-4, a component critical for assembly of TFIID and the pol II preinitiation complex. OMA-1/2 binding to TAF-4 is developmentally regulated, requiring phosphorylation by the DYRK kinase MBK-2, which is activated at meiosis II after fertilization. OMA-1/2 are normally degraded after the first mitosis, but ectopic expression of wild-type OMA-1 is sufficient to repress transcription in both somatic and later germline blastomeres. We propose that phosphorylation by MBK-2 serves as a developmental switch, converting OMA-1/2 from oocyte to embryo regulators. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Recycling of bacterial post-TCs requires elongation factor EF-G and a ribosome recycling factor RRF. Eukaryotes do not encode a RRF homolog, and their mechanism of ribosomal recycling is unknown. We investigated eukaryotic recycling using post-TCs assembled on a model mRNA encoding a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon and report that initiation factors eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3j, a loosely associated subunit of eIF3, can promote recycling of eukaryotic post-TCs. eIF3 is the principal factor that promotes splitting of posttermination ribosomes into 60S subunits and tRNA- and mRNA-bound 40S subunits. Its activity is enhanced by eIFs 3j, 1, and 1A. eIF1 also mediates release of P site tRNA, whereas eIF3j ensures subsequent dissociation of mRNA. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TLR signaling from both locations triggers the TIRAP-dependent assembly of the myddosome, a protein complex that controls proinflammatory cytokine expression. The actions of TIRAP depend on the promiscuity of its phosphoinositide-binding domain. Different lipid targets of this domain direct TIRAP to different organelles, allowing it to survey multiple compartments for the presence of activated TLRs.

Increased CD4 T cell numbers over the first year were associated with high Serratia abundance, pro-inflammatory innate cytokines, and metabolites that drive Th17 gene expression signatures and restoration of mucosal integrity. Subsequently, decreased Serratia abundance and downregulation of innate cytokines allowed re-establishment of systemic T cell homeostasis promoting restoration of Th1 and Th2 gene expression signatures.

However, fusion pores have not been observed and thus proved in live cells. Its regulatory mechanisms and functions remain poorly understood. With super-resolution STED microscopy, we observed dynamic fusion pore behaviors in live (neuroendocrine) cells, including opening, expansion, constriction, and closure, where pore size may vary between 0 and 490 nm within 26 milliseconds to seconds (vesicle size: 180–720 nm). These pore dynamics crucially determine the efficiency of vesicular cargo release and vesicle retrieval. They are generated by competition between pore expansion and constriction. Pharmacology and mutation experiments suggest that expansion and constriction are mediated by F-actin-dependent membrane tension and calcium/dynamin, respectively. These findings provide the missing live-cell evidence, proving the fusion-pore hypothesis, and establish a live-cell dynamic-pore theory accounting for fusion, fission, and their regulation.

It is unknown whether lactate contributes to energy metabolism in living tumors. We previously reported that human non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) oxidize glucose in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here, we show that lactate is also a TCA cycle carbon source for NSCLC. In human NSCLC, evidence of lactate utilization was most apparent in tumors with high 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and aggressive oncological behavior. Infusing human NSCLC patients with 13C-lactate revealed extensive labeling of TCA cycle metabolites. In mice, deleting monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) from tumor cells eliminated lactate-dependent metabolite labeling, confirming tumor-cell-autonomous lactate uptake. Strikingly, directly comparing lactate and glucose metabolism in vivo indicated that lactate's contribution to the TCA cycle predominates. The data indicate that tumors, including bona fide human NSCLC, can use lactate as a fuel in vivo.

In summary, we have identified a biochemical pathway that controls the abundance of dNTPs and ensures efficient DNA repair in response to genotoxic stress. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,D'Angiolella V.; Donato V.; Forrester F.M.; Jeong Y.-T.; Pellacani C.; Kudo Y.; Saraf A.; Florens L.; Washburn M.P.; Pagano M.,68.0,716598017.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2012,8,1.0185432,0.36225984,0.42656276,0.96894336,0.4765786,0.06968608392504,0.6398233,0.4898038,0.08521325778706867,0.54661715,0.4465282,0.0925446099111164,0.62855965,0.4963615,0.11353738064323726,0.6541488,0.6689063906669617,0.24654385447502136

Here, we show that clustered mutations provide a more precise fingerprint of mutagenic processes. Of nine clustered mutation signatures identified from >1,000 tumor genomes, three relate to variable APOBEC activity and three are associated with tobacco smoking. An additional signature matches the spectrum of translesion DNA polymerase eta (POLH). In lymphoid cells, these mutations target promoters, consistent with AID-initiated somatic hypermutation. In solid tumors, however, they are associated with UV exposure and alcohol consumption and target the H3K36me3 chromatin of active genes in a mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner. These regions normally have a low mutation rate because error-free MMR also targets H3K36me3 chromatin. Carcinogens and error-prone repair therefore redistribute mutations to the more important regions of the genome, contributing a substantial mutation load in many tumors, including driver mutations.",cancer genomics; epigenetic marks; euchromatin; localized hypermutation; mismatch repair; oncogenes; somatic single-nucleotide variants; translesion DNA synthesis,Supek F.; Lehner B.,33.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2017,8,0.61236435,0.4463889,0.45711237,0.6553365,0.4468416,0.06713396248881454,0.39442185,0.48145723,0.07961368906081967,0.47888055,0.3712207,0.028482976866154308,0.33950973,0.45991254,0.11897848208691952,0.5357558,0.004454857669770718,-0.031038902699947357

Yet, little is known about tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 pathway effects. Here, we show that murine and human melanomas contain PD-1-expressing cancer subpopulations and demonstrate that melanoma cell-intrinsic PD-1 promotes tumorigenesis, even in mice lacking adaptive immunity. PD-1 inhibition on melanoma cells by RNAi, blocking antibodies, or mutagenesis of melanoma-PD-1 signaling motifs suppresses tumor growth in immunocompetent, immunocompromised, and PD-1-deficient tumor graft recipient mice. Conversely, melanoma-specific PD-1 overexpression enhances tumorigenicity, as does engagement of melanoma-PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, whereas melanoma-PD-L1 inhibition or knockout of host-PD-L1 attenuate growth of PD-1-positive melanomas. Mechanistically, the melanoma-PD-1 receptor modulates downstream effectors of mTOR signaling. Our results identify melanoma cell-intrinsic functions of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis in tumor growth and suggest that blocking melanoma-PD-1 might contribute to the striking clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.",antibody; blockade; immune checkpoint; Melanoma; mTOR signaling; p-S6; PD-1; PD-L1; programmed cell death-1; S6 ribosomal protein; therapy,Kleffel S.; Posch C.; Barthel S.R.; Mueller H.; Schlapbach C.; Guenova E.; Elco C.P.; Lee N.; Juneja V.R.; Zhan Q.; Lian C.G.; Thomi R.; Hoetzenecker W.; Cozzio A.; Dummer R.; Mihm M.C.; Flaherty K.T.; Frank M.H.; Murphy G.F.; Sharpe A.H.; Kupper T.S.; Schatton T.,30.0,725780062.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.6839124,0.5133583,0.48457804,0.68672025,0.46839237,0.061504049150996554,0.54568213,0.49425268,0.07100598466832164,0.5283167,0.39332056,0.05466475145550187,0.6570053,0.4534521,0.08428616204104256,0.6678271,0.313088595867157,-0.03476028889417648

Here we develop a C. elegans model of nicotine-dependent behavior. We show that worms exhibit behavioral responses to nicotine that parallel those observed in mammals, including acute response, tolerance, withdrawal, and sensitization. These nicotine responses require nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family genes that are known to mediate nicotine dependence in mammals, suggesting functional conservation of nAChRs in nicotine responses. Importantly, we find that mutant worms lacking TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels are defective in their response to nicotine and that such a defect can be rescued by a human TRPC channel, revealing an unexpected role for TRPC channels in regulating nicotine-dependent behavior. Thus, C. elegans can be used to characterize known genes as well as to identify new genes regulating nicotine responses. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The first division is preceded by an extended prophase wherein homologous chromosomes undergo recombination. The persistence of cohesion during prophase is essential for recombination and both meiotic divisions. Here we show that Mnd2, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) from budding yeast, is essential to prevent premature destruction of cohesion in meiosis. During S- and prophase, Mnd2 prevents activation of the APC/C by a meiosis-specific activator called Ama1. In cells lacking Mnd2 the APC/C-Ama1 enzyme triggers degradation of Pds1, which causes premature sister chromatid separation due to unrestrained separase activity. In vitro, Mnd2 inhibits ubiquitination of Pds1 by APC/C-Ama1 but not by other APC/C holo-enzymes. We conclude that chromosome segregation in meiosis depends on the selective inhibition of a meiosis-specific form of the APC/C.

Here we show that nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in interphase cells also function as scaffolds for anaphase-inhibitory signaling. This role is mediated by Mad1-Mad2 complexes tethered to the nuclear basket, which activate soluble Mad2 as a binding partner and inhibitor of Cdc20 in the cytoplasm.

We now explore how surface-features of a mobile species determine its NPC passage rate. Negative charges and lysines impede passage. Hydrophobic residues, certain polar residues (Cys, His), and, surprisingly, charged arginines have striking translocation-promoting effects. Favorable cation-π interactions between arginines and FG-phenylalanines may explain this apparent paradox. Application of these principles to redesign the surface of GFP resulted in variants that show a wide span of transit rates, ranging from 35-fold slower than wild-type to ∼500 times faster, with the latter outpacing even naturally occurring nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). The structure of a fast and particularly FG-specific GFPNTR variant illustrates how NTRs can expose multiple regions for binding hydrophobic FG motifs while evading non-specific aggregation. Finally, we document that even for NTR-mediated transport, the surface-properties of the “passively carried” cargo can strikingly affect the translocation rate.",aggregation; cargo; exportin; hydrogel; importin; NTF2; nuclear pore complex; permeability barrier; phase separation; protein homeostasis,Frey S.; Rees R.; Schunemann J.; Ng S.C.; Funfgeld K.; Huyton T.; Gorlich D.,74.0,733528808.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2018,8,0.6474145,0.4463889,0.4365927,0.6608421,0.3826443,0.04877463299015744,0.54597425,0.47484088,0.065308888566256,0.68232024,0.38657987,0.09010315796879775,0.5212529,0.30031252,0.06069730544325552,0.5357558,0.35652342438697815,0.11522962152957916

Here we show that direct nuclear signaling by a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits the responses of precursors to astrocyte differentiation factors while maintaining their neurogenic potential. Upon neuregulin-induced activation and presenilin-dependent cleavage of ErbB4, the receptor's intracellular domain forms a complex with TAB2 and the corepressor N-CoR. This complex undergoes nuclear translocation and binds promoters of astrocytic genes, repressing their expression. Consistent with this observation, astrogenesis occurs precociously in ErbB4 knockout mice.

Our results strongly suggest that hotspot sequences become tethered to axis sites by the DSB machinery prior to DSB formation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Panizza S.; Mendoza M.A.; Berlinger M.; Huang L.; Nicolas A.; Shirahige K.; Klein F.,70.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,8,1.0185432,0.6194424,0.58469254,0.96894336,0.48799038,0.0627759416514912,0.5782518,0.49805605,0.08373805593689254,0.5724587,0.23142445,0.010643021114016882,0.68993366,0.3855828,0.09159953225493356,0.49564517,0.9582954049110413,-0.02184511162340641

Here, we report genome-wide data from 19 Upper Paleolithic to Early Bronze Age individuals from this Siberian region. An Upper Paleolithic genome shows a direct link with the First Americans by sharing the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native Americans. We also demonstrate the formation of Early Neolithic and Bronze Age Baikal populations as the result of prolonged admixture throughout the eighth to sixth millennium BP. Moreover, we detect genetic interactions with western Eurasian steppe populations and reconstruct Yersinia pestis genomes from two Early Bronze Age individuals without western Eurasian ancestry. Overall, our study demonstrates the most deeply divergent connection between Upper Paleolithic Siberians and the First Americans and reveals human and pathogen mobility across Eurasia during the Bronze Age. Genome-wide ancient DNA data from the Lake Baikal and its surroundings, comprising a time transect of 10,000 years from the Upper Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age, reveals deeply divergent ancestry that links Upper Paleolithic Siberians and the First Peoples of the Americas and delineates the complex transition between Early Neolithic and Early Bronze Age populations in Siberia.",ancient genomics; Bronze Age; human history; mobility; Native Americans; Neolithic; Siberia; Upper Paleolithic; Yersinia pestis,Yu H.; Spyrou M.A.; Karapetian M.; Shnaider S.; Radzeviciute R.; Nagele K.; Neumann G.U.; Penske S.; Zech J.; Lucas M.; LeRoux P.; Roberts P.; Pavlenok G.; Buzhilova A.; Posth C.; Jeong C.; Krause J.,156.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2020,8,0.42349273,0.37660182,0.36336285,0.39419758,0.12032151,-0.04095142405134489,0.22987491,0.18784344,0.010643463054961833,0.28135276,0.063149095,0.052654886728137285,0.39453596,-0.36627257,-0.08512438824437496,0.3588477,-0.19001471996307373,-2.0702574253082275

The CASK CaM-kinase domain is presumed to be a catalytically inactive pseudokinase because it lacks the canonical DFG motif required for Mg2+ binding that is thought to be indispensable for kinase activity. Here we show, however, that CASK functions as an active protein kinase even without Mg2+ binding. High-resolution crystal structures reveal that the CASK CaM-kinase domain adopts a constitutively active conformation that binds ATP and catalyzes phosphotransfer without Mg2+. The CASK CaM-kinase domain phosphorylates itself and at least one physiological interactor, the synaptic protein neurexin-1, to which CASK is recruited via its PDZ domain. Thus, our data indicate that CASK combines the scaffolding activity of MAGUKs with an unusual kinase activity that phosphorylates substrates recuited by the scaffolding activity. Moreover, our study suggests that other pseudokinases (10% of the kinome) could also be catalytically active. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP). The latter is further divided into the lid and base subcomplexes. While the mechanism involved in the assembly of the CP is well investigated, that of the RP is poorly understood. Here, we show that the formation of the mammalian base subcomplex involves three distinct modules, where specific pairs of ATPase subunits are associated with the distinct chaperones p28, S5b, or p27. The process of base formation starts from association of the p28-Rpt3-Rpt6-Rpn14 complex with the S5b-Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1 complex, followed by incorporation of the p27-Rpt5-Rpt4 complex and Rpn2, where p28, S5b, and p27 regulate the associations between the modules.

Furthermore, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that a heterodimer of Dpp and Scw, but not the Dpp homodimer, is the primary transported ligand and that the heterodimer signals synergistically through the two type I BMP receptors Tkv and Sax. We propose that the use of broadly distributed Dpp homodimers and spatially restricted Dpp/Scw heterodimers produces the biphasic signal that is responsible for specifying the two dorsal tissue types. Finally, we demonstrate mathematically that heterodimer levels can be less sensitive to changes in gene dosage than homodimers, thereby providing further selective advantage for using heterodimers as morphogens.

Loss of GlcNAcT-IVa, or the addition of glycan-ligand mimetics, attenuates Glut-2 cell-surface half-life, provoking endocytosis with redistribution into endosomes and lysosomes. The ensuing impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion leads to metabolic dysfunction diagnostic of type 2 diabetes. Remarkably, the induction of diabetes by chronic ingestion of a high-fat diet is associated with reduced GlcNAcT-IV expression and attenuated Glut-2 glycosylation coincident with Glut-2 endocytosis.

Obligate GroEL-dependence is limited to only ∼85 substrates, including 13 essential proteins, and occupying more than 75% of GroEL capacity.

We demonstrate that the MEX-5 gradient is a direct consequence of an underlying gradient in MEX-5 diffusivity. The MEX-5 diffusion gradient arises when the PAR-1 kinase stimulates the release of MEX-5 from slow-diffusive, RNA-containing complexes in the posterior cytoplasm. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates MEX-5 and is antagonized by the spatially uniform phosphatase PP2A.

When critically short telomeres arise in the absence of telomerase, they can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) to prevent premature senescence onset.

We demonstrate that the non-coding RNA TERRA accumulates as HDR-promoting RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) preferentially at very short telomeres. The increased level of TERRA and R-loops, exclusively at short telomeres, is due to a local defect in RNA degradation by the Rat1 and RNase H2 nucleases, respectively. Consequently, the coordination of TERRA degradation with telomere replication is altered at shortened telomeres. R-loop persistence at short telomeres contributes to activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and promotes recruitment of the Rad51 recombinase.

Using embryonic stem cells, we show that mammalian Sir2, SIRT1, represses repetitive DNA and a functionally diverse set of genes across the mouse genome. In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 dissociates from these loci and relocalizes to DNA breaks to promote repair, resulting in transcriptional changes that parallel those in the aging mouse brain.

Accordingly, mitophagy, which removes these mitochondria through lysosomal degradation, is attracting broad attention. Due to uncertainties in the operational principles of conventional mitophagy probes, however, the specificity and quantitativeness of their readouts are disputable. Thorough investigation of the behaviors and fates of fluorescent proteins inside and outside lysosomes enabled us to develop an indicator for mitophagy, mito-SRAI. Through strict control of its mitochondrial targeting, we were able to monitor mitophagy in fixed biological samples more reproducibly than before. Large-scale image-based high-throughput screening led to the discovery of a hit compound that induces selective mitophagy of damaged mitochondria. In a mouse model of Parkinsons disease, we found that dopaminergic neurons selectively failed to execute mitophagy that promoted their survival within lesions.

Depletion of TRIP12 and UBR5 allows accumulation of RNF168 to supraphysiological levels, followed by massive spreading of ubiquitin conjugates and hyperaccumulation of ubiquitin-regulated genome caretakers such as 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, regulatory and proteolytic ubiquitylations are wired in a self-limiting circuit that promotes histone ubiquitylation near the DNA lesions but at the same time counteracts its excessive spreading to undamaged chromosomes.

The structure reveals interactions of the dimeric pseudonuclease core of TEFM with mobile structural elements in mtRNAP and the nucleic acid components of the elongation complex (EC). Binding of TEFM to the DNA forms a downstream “sliding clamp,” providing high processivity to the EC. TEFM also binds near the RNA exit channel to prevent formation of the RNA G-quadruplex structure required for termination and thus synthesis of the replication primer.

In addition, p53 R270H/- and p53R172H/- mice developed novel tumors compared to p53-/- mice, including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors. Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in primary cells derived from p53 R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice.

Although Cdc2/cyclin B and polo-like kinase (PLK) can phosphorylate and activate Cdc25 in vitro, phosphorylation by these two kinases is insufficient to account for Cdc25 activation during M phase induction. Here we demonstrate that p42 MAP kinase (MAPK), the Xenopus ortholog of ERK2, is a major Cdc25 phosphorylating kinase in extracts of M phase-arrested Xenopus eggs. In Xenopus oocytes, p42 MAPK interacts with hypophosphorylated Cdc25 before meiotic induction. During meiotic induction, p42 MAPK phosphorylates Cdc25 at T48, T138, and S205, increasing Cdc25's phosphatase activity. In a mammalian cell line, ERK1/2 interacts with Cdc25C in interphase and phosphorylates Cdc25C at T48 in mitosis. Inhibition of ERK activation partially inhibits T48 phosphorylation, Cdc25C activation, and mitotic induction. These findings demonstrate that ERK-MAP kinases are directly involved in activating Cdc25 during the G2/M transition. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Barrier formation requires Epo1, a novel ER-associated subunit of the polarisome that interacts with Scs2 and Shs1.

Here we demonstrate that increased translation of p53 mRNA is also a critical step in the induction of p53 protein in irradiated cells. Ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and nucleolin were found to bind to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA and to control p53 translation and induction after DNA damage. RPL26 preferentially binds to the 5′UTR after DNA damage, and its overexpression enhances association of p53 mRNA with heavier polysomes, increases the rate of p53 translation, induces G1 cell-cycle arrest, and augments irradiation-induced apoptosis. Opposite effects were seen when RPL26 expression was inhibited. In contrast, nucleolin overexpression suppresses p53 translation and induction after DNA damage, whereas nucleolin downregulation promotes p53 expression. These findings demonstrate the importance of increased translation of p53 in DNA-damage responses and suggest critical roles for RPL26 and nucleolin in affecting p53 induction.

This anti-tryptase antibody potently blocks tryptase enzymatic activity in a humanized mouse model, reducing IgE-mediated systemic anaphylaxis, and inhibits airway tryptase in Ascaris-sensitized cynomolgus monkeys with favorable pharmacokinetics. These data provide a foundation for developing anti-tryptase as a clinical therapy for severe asthma. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Type 2-low asthma represents a critical unmet need and an opportunity for new drug discovery. Here, Maun et al. demonstrate that increased mast cell tryptase levels are associated with asthma severity independent of type 2 inflammation and that increased active tryptase alleles are associated with decreased clinical responses to anti-IgE treatment. They generated a noncompetitive inhibitory anti-tryptase antibody with in vivo activity in humanized mouse and cynomolgus monkey models as a clinical candidate for severe asthma treatment.",allosteric protease inhibitor; anti-IgE; anti-tryptase; antibody engineering; asthma; mast cell; non-type 2 asthma; serine protease; tryptase; tryptase genetics,Maun H.R.; Jackman J.K.; Choy D.F.; Loyet K.M.; Staton T.L.; Jia G.; Dressen A.; Hackney J.A.; Bremer M.; Walters B.T.; Vij R.; Chen X.; Trivedi N.N.; Morando A.; Lipari M.T.; Franke Y.; Wu X.; Zhang J.; Liu J.; Wu P.; Chang D.; Orozco L.D.; Christensen E.; Wong M.; Corpuz R.; Hang J.Q.; Lutman J.; Sukumaran S.; Wu Y.; Ubhayakar S.; Liang X.; Schwartz L.B.; Babina M.; Woodruff P.G.; Fahy J.V.; Ahuja R.; Caughey G.H.; Kusi A.; Dennis M.S.; Eigenbrot C.; Kirchhofer D.; Austin C.D.; Wu L.C.; Koerber J.T.; Lee W.P.; Yaspan B.L.; Alatsis K.R.; Arron J.R.; Lazarus R.A.; Yi T.,95.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2019,7,0.51821196,0.3613618,0.37386867,0.52180487,0.4628806,0.06672969576473053,0.5080219,0.47346568,0.06762583193440336,0.70352244,0.39200163,0.04296486805605726,0.46244898,0.41409838,0.03980873466134971,0.48155013,0.3268979489803314,-0.1805064082145691

PCD must be restricted to infection sites to prevent the HR from playing a pathologic rather than protective role. Here we show that plant BECLIN 1, an ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene ATG6/VPS30/beclin 1, functions to restrict HR PCD to infection sites. Initiation of HR PCD is normal in BECLIN 1-deficient plants, but remarkably, healthy uninfected tissue adjacent to HR lesions and leaves distal to the inoculated leaf undergo unrestricted PCD. In the HR PCD response, autophagy is induced in both pathogen-infected cells and distal uninfected cells; this is reduced in BECLIN 1-deficient plants. The restriction of HR PCD also requires orthologs of other autophagy-related genes including PI3K/VPS34, ATG3, and ATG7. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved autophagy pathway plays an essential role in plant innate immunity and negatively regulates PCD.

Here, we investigated the role of zinc (Zn2+) homeostasis, Zn2+ transporters, and Zn2+-dependent transcription factors in OA pathogenesis. Among Zn2+ transporters, the Zn2+ importer ZIP8 was specifically upregulated in OA cartilage of humans and mice, resulting in increased levels of intracellular Zn2+ in chondrocytes. ZIP8-mediated Zn2+ influx upregulated the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP3, MMP9, MMP12, MMP13, and ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. Ectopic expression of ZIP8 in mouse cartilage tissue caused OA cartilage destruction, whereas Zip8 knockout suppressed surgically induced OA pathogenesis, with concomitant modulation of Zn2+ influx and matrix-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, MTF1 was identified as an essential transcription factor in mediating Zn2+/ZIP8-induced catabolic factor expression, and genetic modulation of Mtf1 in mice altered OA pathogenesis.

In Drosophila, the Hunchback transcription factor acts in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) to specify early-born neurons, in part by indirectly inducing the neuronal transcription of its target genes, including the hunchback gene. We used in vivo immuno-DNA FISH and found that the hunchback gene moves to the neuroblast nuclear periphery, a repressive subnuclear compartment, precisely when competence to specify early-born fate is lost and several hours and cell divisions after termination of its transcription. hunchback movement to the lamina correlated with downregulation of the neuroblast nuclear protein, Distal antenna (Dan). Either prolonging Dan expression or disrupting lamina interfered with hunchback repositioning and extended neuroblast competence.

We performed an shRNA screen to identify factors required for class switch recombination (CSR) of antibody loci. We found that Spt5, a factor associated with stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and single stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for CSR. Spt5 interacts with AID, it facilitates association between AID and Pol II, and AID recruitment to its Ig and non-. Ig targets. ChIP-seq experiments reveal that Spt5 colocalizes with AID and stalled Pol II. Further, Spt5 accumulation at sites of Pol II stalling is predictive of AID-induced mutation.

To link identifiable brainstem populations to a potential locomotor stop signal, we used developmental genetics and considered a discrete neuronal population in the reticular formation: the V2a neurons. We find that those neurons constitute a major excitatory pathway to locomotor areas of the ventral spinal cord. Selective activation of V2a neurons of the rostral medulla stops ongoing locomotor activity, owing to an inhibition of premotor locomotor networks in the spinal cord.

Currently, CpG islands are defined based on their genomic sequences alone. Here, we develop evolutionary models to show that several distinct evolutionary processes generate and maintain CpG islands. One central evolutionary regime resulting in enriched CpG content is driven by low levels of DNA methylation and consequentially low rates of CpG deamination. Another major force forming CpG islands is biased gene conversion that stabilizes constitutively methylated CpG islands by balancing rapid deamination with CpG fixation. Importantly, evolutionary analysis and population genetics data suggest that selection for high CpG content is not a significant factor contributing to conservation of CpGs in differentially methylated regions. The heterogeneous, but not selective, origins of CpG islands have direct implications for the understanding of DNA methylation patterns in healthy and diseased cells. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Cohen N.M.; Kenigsberg E.; Tanay A.,45.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,8,0.78202593,0.55524063,0.55314016,0.78691643,0.3993287,0.03982603562167114,0.38277465,0.44739223,0.08770927529048878,0.5879659,0.084696054,0.02473804147286618,0.44423154,0.37788486,0.08790327687462318,0.49191535,0.18777219951152802,0.03258221596479416

In mitosis, a Mad1-Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic Mad2 to kinetochores through Mad2 dimerization and converts Mad2 to a conformer amenable to Cdc20 binding, thereby facilitating checkpoint activation. p31comet inactivates the checkpoint through binding to Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2, thereby preventing Mad2 activation and promoting the dissociation of the Mad2-Cdc20 complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Mad2-p31comet complex. The C-terminal region of Mad2 that undergoes rearrangement in different Mad2 conformers is a major structural determinant for p31comet binding, explaining the specificity of p31comet toward Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2. p31comet adopts a fold strikingly similar to that of Mad2 and binds at the dimerization interface of Mad2. Thus, p31comet exploits the two-state behavior of Mad2 to block its activation by acting as an ""anti-Mad2."". © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies published in Cell produced conflicting results, indicating that loss of Bid either protects or enhances apoptosis induced by DNA damage or replicative stress. To resolve this controversy, we generated novel Bid-deficient mice on an inbred C57BL/6 background and removed the drug-selection cassette from the targeted locus. Nine distinct cell types from these Bid-deficient mice underwent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in a manner indistinguishable from control WT cells in response to DNA damage or replicative stress. Moreover, we found that even cells from the original Bid-deficient mice responded normally to these stimuli, indicating that differences in genetic background or the presence of a strong promoter within the targeted locus are unlikely to explain the differences between our results and those reported previously. We conclude that Bid has no role in DNA damage- or replicative stress-induced apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Brf1 induction caused an increase in cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation, whereas depletion of Brf1 impeded transformation. Among the gene products induced by Brf1 is the tRNAiMet that initiates polypeptide synthesis.

However, chronic activation of cGAS by self-DNA leads to severe autoimmune diseases for which no effective treatment is available yet. Here we report that acetylation inhibits cGAS activation and that the enforced acetylation of cGAS by aspirin robustly suppresses self-DNA-induced autoimmunity. We find that cGAS acetylation on either Lys384, Lys394, or Lys414 contributes to keeping cGAS inactive. cGAS is deacetylated in response to DNA challenges. Importantly, we show that aspirin can directly acetylate cGAS and efficiently inhibit cGAS-mediated immune responses. Finally, we demonstrate that aspirin can effectively suppress self-DNA-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) patient cells and in an AGS mouse model. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation contributes to cGAS activity regulation and provides a potential therapy for treating DNA-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Strikingly, without ATP, we observe the emergence of hundreds of CTCF-independent loops that link regulatory DNA. We also identify architectural “stripes,” where a loop anchor interacts with entire domains at high frequency. Stripes often tether super-enhancers to cognate promoters, and in B cells, they facilitate Igh transcription and recombination. Stripe anchors represent major hotspots for topoisomerase-mediated lesions, which promote chromosomal translocations and cancer. In plasmacytomas, stripes can deregulate Igh-translocated oncogenes.

Using nucleoid mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at physiological DNA concentration.

Using cardiac-specific RNAi-silencing in Drosophila, we knocked down 7061 evolutionarily conserved genes under conditions of stress. We present a first global roadmap of pathways potentially playing conserved roles in the cardiovascular system. One critical pathway identified was the CCR4-Not complex implicated in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. Silencing of CCR4-Not components in adult Drosophila resulted in myofibrillar disarray and dilated cardiomyopathy. Heterozygous not3 knockout mice showed spontaneous impairment of cardiac contractility and increased susceptibility to heart failure. These heart defects were reversed via inhibition of HDACs, suggesting a mechanistic link to epigenetic chromatin remodeling. In humans, we show that a common NOT3 SNP correlates with altered cardiac QT intervals, a known cause of potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

RORγ+ Treg proportions varied between inbred mouse strains, a trait transmitted by the mother during a tight age window after birth but stable for life, resistant to many microbial or cellular perturbations, then further transferred by females for multiple generations. RORγ+ Treg proportions negatively correlated with IgA production and coating of gut commensals, traits also subject to maternal transmission, in an immunoglobulin- and RORγ+ Treg-dependent manner.

With fast optogenetic methods, we examine the real-time contribution of hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons to remote memory and find that contextual fear memory recall, even weeks after training, can be reversibly abolished by temporally precise optogenetic inhibition of CA1. When this inhibition is extended to match the typical time course of pharmacological inhibition, remote hippocampus dependence converts to hippocampus independence, suggesting that long-term memory retrieval normally depends on the hippocampus but can adaptively shift to alternate structures.

To determine whether PKM2 is required for tumor formation or growth, we generated mice with a conditional allele that abolishes PKM2 expression without disrupting PKM1 expression. PKM2 deletion accelerated mammary tumor formation in a Brca1-loss-driven model of breast cancer. PKM2 null tumors displayed heterogeneous PKM1 expression, with PKM1 found in nonproliferating tumor cells and no detectable pyruvate kinase expression in proliferating cells. This suggests that PKM2 is not necessary for tumor cell proliferation and implies that the inactive state of PKM2 is associated with the proliferating cell population within tumors, whereas nonproliferating tumor cells require active pyruvate kinase. Consistent with these findings, variable PKM2 expression and heterozygous PKM2 mutations are found in human tumors. These data suggest that regulation of PKM2 activity supports the different metabolic requirements of proliferating and nonproliferating tumor cells.

Despite interesting clinical results in hematological malignancies, the development of bispecific killer-cell-engager antibody formats directed against tumor cells and stimulating anti-tumor T cell immunity has proved challenging, mostly due to toxicity problems. We report here the generation of trifunctional natural killer (NK) cell engagers (NKCEs), targeting two activating receptors, NKp46 and CD16, on NK cells and a tumor antigen on cancer cells. Trifunctional NKCEs were more potent in vitro than clinical therapeutic antibodies targeting the same tumor antigen. They had similar in vivo pharmacokinetics to full IgG antibodies and no off-target effects and efficiently controlled tumor growth in mouse models of solid and invasive tumors. Trifunctional NKCEs thus constitute a new generation of molecules for fighting cancer.

We report that the main protein entry gate of mitochondria, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex), is phosphorylated by cytosolic kinases - in particular, casein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein kinase A (PKA). CK2 promotes biogenesis of the TOM complex by phosphorylation of two key components, the receptor Tom22 and the import protein Mim1, which in turn are required for import of further Tom proteins. Inactivation of CK2 decreases the levels of the TOM complex and thus mitochondrial protein import. PKA phosphorylates Tom70 under nonrespiring conditions, thereby inhibiting its receptor activity and the import of mitochondrial metabolite carriers. We conclude that cytosolic kinases exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects on biogenesis and function of the TOM complex and thus regulate protein import into mitochondria. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Schmidt O.; Harbauer A.B.; Rao S.; Eyrich B.; Zahedi R.P.; Stojanovski D.; Schonfisch B.; Guiard B.; Sickmann A.; Pfanner N.; Meisinger C.,56.0,8927956.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,8,0.9178301,0.5836932,0.5666705,0.9332605,0.39310443,0.039151286601686486,0.51976466,0.47267413,0.05104129435651911,0.68465424,0.46082807,0.11202035539083172,0.5282862,0.31321478,0.07699683914580235,0.63039714,0.42702606320381165,0.37747904658317566

Our previous studies demonstrated that the coiled-coil protein centriolin localized to the midbody during cytokinesis and was required for abscission. Here we show that centriolin interacts with proteins of vesicle-targeting exocyst complexes and vesicle-fusion SNARE complexes. These complexes require centriolin for localization to a unique midbody-ring structure, and disruption of either complex inhibits abscission. Exocyst disruption induces accumulation of v-SNARE-containing vesicles at the midbody ring. In control cells, these v-SNARE vesicles colocalize with a GFP-tagged secreted polypeptide. The vesicles move to the midbody ring asymmetrically from one prospective daughter cell; the GFP signal is rapidly lost, suggesting membrane fusion; and subsequently the cell cleaves at the site of vesicle delivery/fusion. We propose that centriolin anchors protein complexes required for vesicle targeting and fusion and integrates membrane-vesicle fusion with abscission.

Translocation of the IRES by elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is required to bring the first codon of the mRNA into the A site and to allow the start of translation. © 2014 The Authors.",,Fernandez I.S.; Bai X.-C.; Murshudov G.; Scheres S.H.W.; Ramakrishnan V.,47.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,8,0.44848952,0.37835985,0.3801989,0.43704766,0.4947784,0.09932031610305175,0.5324863,0.4895985,0.08709917631846226,0.4644728,0.35546672,0.08476070903640032,0.45019057,0.3959986,0.038166741403114934,0.6115571,0.006715584546327591,-0.12705610692501068

These self-regulating auxin gradients are established by the action of PIN auxin transporters, whose activity is regulated by their constitutive cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes. Here, we show that auxin signaling by the auxin receptor AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) inhibits the clathrin-mediated internalization of PIN proteins. ABP1 acts as a positive factor in clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting endocytosis. Auxin binding to ABP1 interferes with this action and leads to the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study demonstrates that ABP1 mediates a nontranscriptional auxin signaling that regulates the evolutionarily conserved process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and suggests that this signaling may be essential for the developmentally important feedback of auxin on its own transport. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,Robert S.; Kleine-Vehn J.; Barbez E.; Sauer M.; Paciorek T.; Baster P.; Vanneste S.; Zhang J.; Simon S.; Covanova M.; Hayashi K.; Dhonukshe P.; Yang Z.; Bednarek S.Y.; Jones A.M.; Luschnig C.; Aniento F.; Zazimalova E.; Friml J.,61.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2010,7,1.2400146,0.6505956,0.64604217,1.3560228,0.49355602,0.07843370225771629,0.6442138,0.38579404,0.0355796193579766,0.62382424,0.44145083,0.09392862471727098,0.56270623,0.41808605,0.10243200376189004,0.69637495,0.5754445791244507,0.35872891545295715

Here, we found that indel generation by Cas9 and guide RNA can occur at steady rates, in contrast to typical dynamic biological reactions, and the accumulated indel frequency can be a function of time. By measuring indel frequencies, we developed a method for recording and measuring absolute time periods over hours to weeks in mammalian cells. These time-recordings were conducted in several cell types, with different promoters and delivery vectors for Cas9, and in both cultured cells and cells of living mice. As applications, we recorded the duration of chemical exposure and the lengths of elapsed time since the onset of biological events (e.g., heat exposure and inflammation).

Several key steps in its activation are mediated by the ubiquitin (Ub) system. One uncharacterized step is limited proteasomal processing of the NF-κB1 precursor p105 to the p50 active subunit. Here, we identify KPC1 as the Ub ligase (E3) that binds to the ankyrin repeats domain of p105, ubiquitinates it, and mediates its processing both under basal conditions and following signaling. Overexpression of KPC1 inhibits tumor growth likely mediated via excessive generation of p50. Also, overabundance of p50 downregulates p65, suggesting that a p50-p50 homodimer may modulate transcription in place of the tumorigenic p50-p65. Transcript analysis reveals increased expression of genes associated with tumor-suppressive signals. Overall, KPC1 regulation of NF-κB1 processing appears to constitute an important balancing step among the stimulatory and inhibitory activities of the transcription factor in cell growth control.",,Kravtsova-Ivantsiv Y.; Shomer I.; Cohen-Kaplan V.; Snijder B.; Superti-Furga G.; Gonen H.; Sommer T.; Ziv T.; Admon A.; Naroditsky I.; Jbara M.; Brik A.; Pikarsky E.; Kwon Y.T.; Doweck I.; Ciechanover A.,46.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.23479334,0.37232915,0.38270476,0.40174976,0.50910133,0.10840209089332997,0.59017855,0.5017738,0.08058692937893847,0.6619272,0.4035585,0.07974516559568923,0.6975535,0.4702084,0.09762669266180729,0.62864774,0.4869143068790436,0.05111677572131157

ER stress elicits the unfolded protein response (UPR), whose components attenuate protein synthesis, increase folding capacity, and enhance misfolded protein degradation. Here, we report that P58IPK/DNAJC3, a UPR-responsive gene previously implicated in translational control, encodes a cytosolic cochaperone that associates with the ER protein translocation channel Sec61. P58IPK recruits HSP70 chaperones to the cytosolic face of Sec61 and can be crosslinked to proteins entering the ER that are delayed at the translocon. Proteasome-mediated cytosolic degradation of translocating proteins delayed at Sec61 is cochaperone dependent. In P58IPK-/- mice, cells with a high secretory burden are markedly compromised in their ability to cope with ER stress. Thus, P58IPK is a key mediator of cotranslocational ER protein degradation, and this process likely contributes to ER homeostasis in stressed cells. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We whole-genome sequenced 446 colonic crypts from 46 IBD patients and compared these to 412 crypts from 41 non-IBD controls from our previous publication on the mutation landscape of the normal colon. The average mutation rate of affected colonic epithelial cells is 2.4-fold that of healthy colon, and this increase is mostly driven by acceleration of mutational processes ubiquitously observed in normal colon. In contrast to the normal colon, where clonal expansions outside the confines of the crypt are rare, we observed widespread millimeter-scale clonal expansions. We discovered non-synonymous mutations in ARID1A, FBXW7, PIGR, ZC3H12A, and genes in the interleukin 17 and Toll-like receptor pathways, under positive selection in IBD. These results suggest distinct selection mechanisms in the colitis-affected colon and that somatic mutations potentially play a causal role in IBD pathogenesis. © 2020 The Author(s)Whole-genome sequencing of inflammatory bowel disease patient samples allows insight into mutational burdens and processes associated with disease, including putative driver mutations positively selected in the diseased colon.",Crohn's disease; IL17; inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal epithelia; mutation rate; mutational signatures; PIGR; somatic mutations; ulcerative colitis; ZC3H12A,Olafsson S.; McIntyre R.E.; Coorens T.; Butler T.; Jung H.; Robinson P.S.; Lee-Six H.; Sanders M.A.; Arestang K.; Dawson C.; Tripathi M.; Strongili K.; Hooks Y.; Stratton M.R.; Parkes M.; Martincorena I.; Raine T.; Campbell P.J.; Anderson C.A.,66.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2020,8,0.74178636,0.5512501,0.49907675,0.5915113,0.41632867,0.01601569698029559,0.36091644,0.46126127,0.05954582640886685,0.40011695,0.47710896,0.11309834224076853,0.5356853,0.3825115,0.03509301169466311,0.42064497,0.17999710142612457,-0.16697750985622406

We demonstrate that ApoE binding to ApoE receptors activates dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK), a MAP-kinase kinase kinase that then activates MKK7 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Activated ERK1/2 induces cFos phosphorylation, stimulating the transcription factor AP-1, which in turn enhances transcription of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and thereby increases amyloid-β levels.

Organoids closely recapitulate several properties of the original tumor. The spectrum of genetic changes within the ""living biobank"" agrees well with previous large-scale mutational analyses of CRC. Gene expression analysis indicates that the major CRC molecular subtypes are represented. Tumor organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens allowing detection of gene-drug associations.

The Drosophila HP1 homolog Rhino is required for germline piRNA production. We show that Rhino binds specifically to the heterochromatic clusters that produce piRNA precursors, and that binding directly correlates with piRNA production. Rhino colocalizes to germline nuclear foci with Rai1/DXO-related protein Cuff and the DEAD box protein UAP56, which are also required for germline piRNA production. RNA sequencing indicates that most cluster transcripts are not spliced and that rhino, cuff, and uap56 mutations increase expression of spliced cluster transcripts over 100-fold. LacI::Rhino fusion protein binding suppresses splicing of a reporter transgene and is sufficient to trigger piRNA production from a trans combination of sense and antisense reporters. We therefore propose that Rhino anchors a nuclear complex that suppresses cluster transcript splicing and speculate that stalled splicing differentiates piRNA precursors from mRNAs. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Zhang Z.; Wang J.; Schultz N.; Zhang F.; Parhad S.S.; Tu S.; Vreven T.; Zamore P.D.; Weng Z.; Theurkauf W.E.,51.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,7,0.44848952,0.37835985,0.3801989,0.43704766,0.48230135,0.06642689889068493,0.52014756,0.47095478,0.08826020275975671,0.46293825,0.40489018,0.08103712011400138,0.6001187,0.3027829,0.051259001205626153,0.649096,0.5191885232925415,0.04669211804866791

While RNAi inheritance mechanisms that enable ""memorization"" of ancestral responses are being elucidated, the mechanisms that determine the duration of inherited silencing and the ability to forget the inherited epigenetic effects are not known. We now show that exposure to dsRNA activates a feedback loop whereby gene-specific RNAi responses dictate the transgenerational duration of RNAi responses mounted against unrelated genes, elicited separately in previous generations. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that, aside from silencing of genes with complementary sequences, dsRNA-induced RNAi affects the production of heritable endogenous small RNAs, which regulate the expression of RNAi factors. Manipulating genes in this feedback pathway changes the duration of heritable silencing.

The mechanisms that convert modest differences in substrate-ligase interactions into decisive outcomes of ubiquitination are not well understood. Here, we reconstitute membrane protein recognition and ubiquitination in liposomes using purified components from a viral-mediated degradation pathway. We find that substrate-ligase interactions in the membrane directly influence processivity of ubiquitin attachment to modulate polyubiquitination. Unexpectedly, differential processivity alone could not explain the differential fates in cultured cells of degraded and nondegraded clients. Both computational and experimental analyses identified continuous deubiquitination as a prerequisite for maximal substrate discrimination. Deubiquitinases reduce polyubiquitin dwell times preferentially on clients that dissociate more rapidly from the ligase. This explains how small differences in substrate-ligase interaction can be amplified into larger differences in net degradation.

Galectin-3 (Gal3), a lectin mainly secreted by macrophages, is elevated in both obese subjects and mice. Administration of Gal3 to mice causes insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, whereas inhibition of Gal3, through either genetic or pharmacologic loss of function, improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice. In vitro treatment with Gal3 directly enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of glucose output in primary mouse hepatocytes. Importantly, we found that Gal3 can bind directly to the insulin receptor (IR) and inhibit downstream IR signaling.

In biochemical assays, the Xlr proteinase has similar affinities for its endogenous substrate Chordin and for its competitive inhibitor Sizzled, which is resistant to enzyme digestion. Extracellular levels of Sizzled and Chordin in the gastrula embryo and enzyme reaction constants were all in the 10-8 M range, consistent with a physiological role in the regulation of dorsal-ventral patterning.

Small RNA-induced gene silencing can persist over several generations via transgenerationally inherited small RNA molecules in C. elegans, but all known transgenerational silencing responses are directed against foreign DNA introduced into the organism. We found that starvation-induced developmental arrest, a natural and drastic environmental change, leads to the generation of small RNAs that are inherited through at least three consecutive generations. These small, endogenous, transgenerationally transmitted RNAs target genes with roles in nutrition. We defined genes that are essential for this multigenerational effect.

Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and tangential expansion. In contrast, lower levels promote radial expansion, with a potent increase of the number of intermediate progenitors and basal radial glial cells leading to folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP1 expression levels exhibit regional differences in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses, anticipating radial or tangential expansion.

Current paradigms propose that PI(4)P acts primarily as a precursor to phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2), an important plasma membrane regulator. We found that PI(4)P is enriched in the mammalian Golgi, and used RNA interference (RNAi) of PI4KIIα, a Golgi resident phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase, to determine whether PI(4)P directly regulates the Golgi. PI4KIIα RNAi decreases Golgi PI(4)P, blocks the recruitment of clathrin adaptor AP-1 complexes to the Golgi, and inhibits AP-1-dependent functions. This AP-1 binding defect is rescued by adding back PI(4)P. In addition, purified AP-1 binds PI(4)P, and anti-PI(4)P inhibits the in vitro recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 to normal cellular membranes.

Although overexpression and stabilization of the histone H3 lysine 9/36 (H3K9/36) tri-demethylase KDM4A generates transient site-specific copy number gains (TSSGs), additional mechanisms directly controlling site-specific DNA copy gains are not well defined. In this study, we uncover a collection of H3K4-modifying chromatin regulators that function with H3K9 and H3K36 regulators to orchestrate TSSGs. Specifically, the H3K4 tri-demethylase KDM5A and specific COMPASS/KMT2 H3K4 methyltransferases modulate different TSSG loci through H3K4 methylation states and KDM4A recruitment. Furthermore, a distinct chromatin modifier network, MLL1-KDM4B-KDM5B, controls copy number regulation at a specific genomic locus in a KDM4A-independent manner. These pathways comprise an epigenetic addressing system for defining site-specific DNA rereplication and amplifications.

However, little is known about how human antibodies confer functional immunity against this antigen. We isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PfRH5 from peripheral blood B cells from vaccinees in the first clinical trial of a PfRH5-based vaccine. We identified a subset of mAbs with neutralizing activity that bind to three distinct sites and another subset of mAbs that are non-functional, or even antagonistic to neutralizing antibodies. We also identify the epitope of a novel group of non-neutralizing antibodies that significantly reduce the speed of red blood cell invasion by the merozoite, thereby potentiating the effect of all neutralizing PfRH5 antibodies as well as synergizing with antibodies targeting other malaria invasion proteins. Our results provide a roadmap for structure-guided vaccine development to maximize antibody efficacy against blood-stage malaria.

NORAD is highly conserved and abundant, with expression levels of approximately 500-1,000 copies per cell. Remarkably, inactivation of NORAD triggers dramatic aneuploidy in previously karyotypically stable cell lines. NORAD maintains genomic stability by sequestering PUMILIO proteins, which repress the stability and translation of mRNAs to which they bind. In the absence of NORAD, PUMILIO proteins drive chromosomal instability by hyperactively repressing mitotic, DNA repair, and DNA replication factors.

Strikingly, inhibitory responses are widespread among receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire provide a rich representation of odor quality, quantity, and duration.

We undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the KRAS oncogene. We discovered a diverse set of proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and the proteasome that, when inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature.

Germline deletion of Sox17 led to severe fetal hematopoietic defects, including a lack of detectable definitive HSCs. Conditional deletion of Sox17 from hematopoietic cells led to the loss of fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs. HSCs stopped expressing Sox17 approximately 4 weeks after birth. During this transition, loss of Sox17 expression correlated with slower proliferation and the acquisition of an adult phenotype by individual HSCs.

These data suggest a structural mechanism for the organization of Atg9 vesicles into the early phagophore. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Ragusa M.J.; Stanley R.E.; Hurley J.H.,56.0,717999297.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2012,8,0.8523387,0.5836932,0.5666705,0.85231704,0.46334517,0.0765180394116391,0.57998556,0.38818645,0.058065751504842944,0.60299677,0.47740543,0.11017174748451897,0.5188925,0.36383855,0.07859039825655051,0.75135136,0.3960752785205841,0.42500078678131104

Outer-membrane fusion requires trans interactions of the dynamin-related GTPase Fzo1, GTP hydrolysis, and an intact inner-membrane proton gradient. Inner-membrane fusion also requires GTP hydrolysis but distinctly requires an inner-membrane electrical potential. The protein machinery responsible for inner-membrane fusion is unknown. Here, we show that the conserved intermembrane-space dynamin-related GTPase Mgm1 is required to tether and fuse mitochondrial inner membranes. We observe an additional role of Mgm1 in inner-membrane dynamics, specifically in the maintenance of crista structures.

Furthermore, both Mbd3 and Brg1 play key roles in the biology of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC): Mbd3 colocalizes with Tet1 and 5hmC in vivo, Mbd3 knockdown preferentially affects expression of 5hmC-marked genes, Mbd3 localization is Tet1-dependent, and Mbd3 preferentially binds to 5hmC relative to 5-methylcytosine in vitro.

How catalysis works within the viscous, water-excluding, two-dimensional membrane is unknown. We developed an inducible reconstitution system to interrogate rhomboid proteolysis quantitatively within the membrane in real time. Remarkably, rhomboid proteases displayed no physiological affinity for substrates (Kd ∼190 μM/0.1 mol%). Instead, ∼10,000-fold differences in proteolytic efficiency with substrate mutants and diverse rhomboid proteases were reflected in kcat values alone. Analysis of gate-open mutant and solvent isotope effects revealed that substrate gating, not hydrolysis, is rate limiting. Ultimately, a single proteolytic event within the membrane normally takes minutes. Rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis is thus a slow, kinetically controlled reaction not driven by transmembrane protein-protein affinity.

Our analysis revealed a collective space-sensing mechanism, which entails sequential actions of an integral feedback loop and an incoherent feedforward loop. The integral feedback is implemented by the accumulation of a diffusive chemical produced by a colony. This accumulation, combined with nutrient consumption, sets the timing for ring initiation.

This ability has been linked to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). To investigate how information is encoded and transmitted through this circuit, we performed electrophysiological recordings in mice observing a demonstrator mouse undergo associative fear conditioning and found that BLA-projecting ACC (ACC→BLA) neurons preferentially encode socially derived aversive cue information. Inhibition of ACC→BLA alters real-time amygdala representation of the aversive cue during observational conditioning. Selective inhibition of the ACC→BLA projection impaired acquisition, but not expression, of observational fear conditioning. We show that information derived from observation about the aversive value of the cue is transmitted from the ACC to the BLA and that this routing of information is critically instructive for observational fear conditioning.

We have investigated the contribution of Top2 in S phase transcription. Specifically in S phase, Top2 binds intergenic regions close to transcribed genes. The Top2-bound loci exhibit low nucleosome density and accumulate γH2A when Top2 is defective. These intergenic loci associate with the HMG protein Hmo1 throughout the cell cycle and are refractory to the histone variant Htz1. In top2 mutants, Hmo1 is deleterious and accumulates at pericentromeric regions in G2/M. Our data indicate that Top2 is dispensable for transcription and that Hmo1 and Top2 bind in the proximity of genes transcribed in S phase suppressing chromosome fragility at the M-G1 transition. We propose that an Hmo1-dependent epigenetic signature together with Top2 mediate an S phase architectural pathway to preserve genome integrity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The initiator role of PAR-1 is further underscored by the fact that mutating PAR-1 phosphorylation sites causes a much greater reduction of overall tau phosphorylation and toxicity than mutating S202, one of the downstream sites whose phosphorylation depends on prior PAR-1 action. These findings begin to differentiate the effects of various phosphorylation events on tau toxicity and provide potential therapeutic targets.",,Nishimura I.; Yang Y.; Lu B.,53.0,1018279.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2004,8,1.3057802,0.65586346,0.6763922,1.3087994,0.48844385,0.07077225473296933,0.59017855,0.41007495,0.04596851832603288,0.5558238,0.28730965,-0.024086676960562214,0.4891955,0.46826077,0.0970883324438192,0.6326971,0.7770398259162903,0.2541380822658539

We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs might be accomplished during development.

Looking at post-transcriptional regulation, we now show that LINE-1 mRNA 3′ ends are pervasively uridylated in various human cellular models and in mouse testes. TUT4 and TUT7 uridyltransferases catalyze the modification and function in cooperation with the helicase/RNPase MOV10 to counteract the RNA chaperone activity of the L1-ORF1p retrotransposon protein. Uridylation potently restricts LINE-1 retrotransposition by a multilayer mechanism depending on differential subcellular localization of the uridyltransferases. We propose that uridine residues added by TUT7 in the cytoplasm inhibit initiation of reverse transcription of LINE-1 mRNAs once they are reimported to the nucleus, whereas uridylation by TUT4, which is enriched in cytoplasmic foci, destabilizes mRNAs. These results provide a model for the post-transcriptional restriction of LINE-1, revealing a key physiological role for TUT4/7-mediated uridylation in maintaining genome stability.

However, this approach cannot reveal sufficient complexity to provide information on mechanisms that may regulate mRNA degradation, possibly on short timescales. To address this deficiency, we measured cell cycle-regulated decay in single yeast cells using single-molecule FISH. We found that two genes responsible for mitotic progression, SWI5 and CLB2, exhibit a mitosis-dependent mRNA stability switch. Their transcripts are stable until mitosis, when a precipitous decay eliminates the mRNA complement, preventing carryover into the next cycle. Remarkably, the specificity and timing of decay is entirely regulated by their promoter, independent of specific cis mRNA sequences.

Here, we report that NuA4 acetylation of Sip2, a regulatory β subunit of the Snf1 complex (yeast AMP-activated protein kinase), decreases as cells age. Sip2 acetylation, controlled by antagonizing NuA4 acetyltransferase and Rpd3 deacetylase, enhances interaction with Snf1, the catalytic subunit of Snf1 complex. Sip2-Snf1 interaction inhibits Snf1 activity, thus decreasing phosphorylation of a downstream target, Sch9 (homolog of Akt/S6K), and ultimately leading to slower growth but extended replicative life span. Sip2 acetylation mimetics are more resistant to oxidative stress. We further demonstrate that the anti-aging effect of Sip2 acetylation is independent of extrinsic nutrient availability and TORC1 activity.

We have discovered stem cells in the adult carotid body (CB), an oxygen-sensing organ of the sympathoadrenal lineage that grows in chronic hypoxemia. Production of new neuron-like CB glomus cells depends on a population of stem cells, which form multipotent and self-renewing colonies in vitro. Cell fate mapping experiments indicate that, unexpectedly, CB stem cells are the glia-like sustentacular cells and can be identified using glial markers. Remarkably, stem cell-derived glomus cells have the same complex chemosensory properties as mature in situ glomus cells. They are highly dopaminergic and produce glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, the mammalian CB is a neurogenic center with a recognizable physiological function in adult life.

Understanding how the interplay between nascent RNA folding and protein binding determines the fate of transcripts remains a major challenge. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we follow assembly of the entire 3′ domain of the bacterial small ribosomal subunit in real time. We find that co-transcriptional rRNA folding is complicated by the formation of long-range RNA interactions and that r-proteins self-chaperone the rRNA folding process prior to stable incorporation into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Assembly is initiated by transient rather than stable protein binding, and the protein-RNA binding dynamics gradually decrease during assembly.

The molecular details of how the coat proteins deform the lipid bilayer into vesicles are not known. Here we show that the small GTPase Sar1p directly initiates membrane curvature during vesicle biogenesis. Upon GTP binding by Sar1p, membrane insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic α helix deforms synthetic liposomes into narrow tubules. Replacement of bulky hydrophobic residues in the α helix with alanine yields Sar1p mutants that are unable to generate highly curved membranes and are defective in vesicle formation from native ER membranes despite normal recruitment of coat and cargo proteins. Thus, the initiation of vesicle budding by Sar1p couples the generation of membrane curvature with coat-protein assembly and cargo capture.

Here, by investigating how chromatin dynamics regulate transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage in human cells, we identify a pathway involving the histone chaperone histone regulator A (HIRA) to promote transcription restart after UVC damage. Our mechanistic studies reveal that HIRA accumulates at sites of UVC irradiation upon detection of DNA damage prior to repair and deposits newly synthesized H3.3 histones. This local action of HIRA depends on ubiquitylation events associated with damage recognition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the early and transient function of HIRA in response to DNA damage primes chromatin for later reactivation of transcription.

Genetic ablation or pharmacological inactivation of Bcl-xL reduces platelet half-life and causes thrombocytopenia in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion of Bak corrects these defects, and platelets from Bak-deficient mice live longer than normal. Thus, platelets are, by default, genetically programmed to die by apoptosis. The antagonistic balance between Bcl-xL and Bak constitutes a molecular clock that determines platelet life span: this represents an important paradigm for cellular homeostasis, and has profound implications for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that affect platelet number and function. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21CIP1/WAF1 promoter. Following disruption of β-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21CIP1/WAF1 transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation.

Previously we found that a translation regulator CPEB from Aplysia, ApCPEB, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, ApCPEB can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous ApCPEB to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric ApCPEB blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that ApCPEB can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time.

PGE2 modified the wnt signaling cascade at the level of β-catenin degradation through cAMP/PKA-mediated stabilizing phosphorylation events. The PGE2/Wnt interaction regulated murine stem and progenitor populations in vitro in hematopoietic ES cell assays and in vivo following transplantation.

In the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop, FRQ and FRH form the FFC complex that represses frq transcription. Here, we show that FFC also binds frq RNA and interacts with the exosome to regulate frq RNA decay. Consequently, frq RNA is robustly rhythmic as it is more stable when FRQ levels are low. Silencing of RRP44, the catalytic subunit of the exosome, elevates frq RNA levels and impairs clock function.

Passive transfer of broadly neutralizing MAbs protected mice against infection by chikungunya, Mayaro, and O'nyong'nyong alphaviruses. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, loss-of-function recombinant proteins and viruses, and multiple functional assays, we determined that broadly neutralizing MAbs block multiple steps in the viral lifecycle, including entry and egress, and bind to a conserved epitope on the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein. A 16 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Fab fragment bound to CHIKV E2 B domain provided an explanation for its neutralizing activity. Binding to the B domain was associated with repositioning of the A domain of E2 that enabled cross-linking of neighboring spikes. Our results suggest that B domain antigenic determinants could be targeted for vaccine or antibody therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses of global concern. A class of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies identified here protects against infection and disease in vivo against multiple alphaviruses, including chikungunya. These antibodies bind a discrete epitope on the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein, block viral entry and egress, and allow cross-linking of adjacent E2 protein spikes, suggesting avenues for possible vaccine- or antibody-based therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses.",,Fox J.M.; Long F.; Edeling M.A.; Lin H.; Van Duijl-Richter M.K.S.; Fong R.H.; Kahle K.M.; Smit J.M.; Jin J.; Simmons G.; Doranz B.J.; Crowe J.E.; Fremont D.H.; Rossmann M.G.; Diamond M.S.,42.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.49389628,0.40951857,0.41140884,0.48245442,0.49645185,0.08299908246382576,0.52589893,0.4954102,0.08556796354787716,0.3352875,0.38949776,0.06952962022462222,0.6387405,0.43283033,0.03694190188200741,0.49476758,0.13878153264522552,-0.6569790244102478

Although it has been extensively studied, especially as a model system for neurophysiology, the cellular processes involved in constructing and organizing the hippocampus remain largely unclear. Here, we show that clonally related excitatory neurons in the developing hippocampus are progressively organized into discrete horizontal, but not vertical, clusters in the stratum pyramidale, as revealed by both cell-type-specific retroviral labeling and mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM). Moreover, distinct from those in the neocortex, sister excitatory neurons in the cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus rarely develop electrical or chemical synapses with each other. Instead, they preferentially receive common synaptic input from nearby fast-spiking (FS), but not non-FS, interneurons and exhibit synchronous synaptic activity. These results suggest that shared inhibitory input may specify horizontally clustered sister excitatory neurons as functional units in the hippocampus.

Aneuploidy frequently arises during the early mitotic divisions of the embryo, but its origin remains elusive.

Here, we show that the parental genomes cluster with nucleoli in each pronucleus within human and bovine zygotes, and clustering is required for the reliable unification of the parental genomes after fertilization. During migration of intact pronuclei, the parental genomes polarize toward each other in a process driven by centrosomes, dynein, microtubules, and nuclear pore complexes. The maternal and paternal chromosomes eventually cluster at the pronuclear interface, in direct proximity to each other, yet separated. Parental genome clustering ensures the rapid unification of the parental genomes on nuclear envelope breakdown.

The DV patterning is so robust that an amphibian embryo with its ventral half surgically removed can develop into a smaller but proportionally patterned larva. Here, we show that this robust patterning depends on facilitated Chordin degradation and requires the expression of the Chordin-proteinase inhibitor Sizzled on the opposite side. Sizzled, which is stable and diffuses widely along the DV axis, stabilizes Chordin and expands its distribution in the ventral direction. This expanded Chordin distribution, in turn, limits BMP-dependent Sizzled production, forming an axis-wide feedback loop for shaping Chordin's activity. Using bisection assays, we demonstrate that Chordin degradation is dynamically controlled by embryo-size-coupled Sizzled accumulation.

Our study provides a molecular mechanism involving protein deubiquitination that connects two important tumor suppressors, p53 and Beclin1, and a potent small molecule inhibitor of autophagy as a possible lead compound for developing anticancer drugs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Liu J.; Xia H.; Kim M.; Xu L.; Li Y.; Zhang L.; Cai Y.; Norberg H.V.; Zhang T.; Furuya T.; Jin M.; Zhu Z.; Wang H.; Yu J.; Li Y.; Hao Y.; Choi A.; Ke H.; Ma D.; Yuan J.,33.0,13334968.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,8,1.2504735,0.5404398,0.35454348,1.2365098,0.43688953,0.06697503929193388,0.5740751,0.49393976,0.09356220745460614,0.61887217,0.34847045,0.08434835573285532,0.66708034,0.39913118,0.07177600206538032,0.6471558,0.41551727056503296,0.11944874376058578

Although prior work identified the centromeric histone H3-variant CENP-A as the important upstream factor necessary for centromere specification, in human cells CENP-A is not sufficient for kinetochore assembly. Here, we demonstrate that two constitutive DNA-binding kinetochore components, CENP-C and CENP-T, function to direct kinetochore formation. Replacing the DNA-binding regions of CENP-C and CENP-T with alternate chromosome-targeting domains recruits these proteins to ectopic loci, resulting in CENP-A-independent kinetochore assembly. These ectopic kinetochore-like foci are functional based on the stoichiometric assembly of multiple kinetochore components, including the microtubule-binding KMN network, the presence of microtubule attachments, the microtubule-sensitive recruitment of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, and the segregation behavior of foci-containing chromosomes. We additionally find that CENP-T phosphorylation regulates the mitotic assembly of both endogenous and ectopic kinetochores.

Although several anti-hypertensive drugs have been developed as AT1R blockers (ARBs), the structural basis for AT1R ligand-binding and regulation has remained elusive, mostly due to the difficulties of growing high-quality crystals for structure determination using synchrotron radiation. By applying the recently developed method of serial femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser, we successfully determined the room-temperature crystal structure of the human AT1R in complex with its selective antagonist ZD7155 at 2.9-Å resolution. The AT1R-ZD7155 complex structure revealed key structural features of AT1R and critical interactions for ZD7155 binding.

Here we show that, in E. coli, the outcome of such collisions depends on the productive state of transcription elongation complexes (ECs). Codirectional collisions with backtracked (arrested) ECs lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas head-on collisions do not. A mechanistic model is proposed to explain backtracking-mediated DSBs. We further show that bacteria employ various strategies to avoid replisome collisions with backtracked RNAP, the most general of which is translation that prevents RNAP backtracking. If translation is abrogated, DSBs are suppressed by elongation factors that either prevent backtracking or reactivate backtracked ECs. Finally, termination factors also contribute to genomic stability by removing arrested ECs.

Extensive complementarity between an siRNA and its target slows the rate at which fly Argonaute2 (Ago2) binds to and dissociates from the target. Highlighting its role in antiviral defense, fly Ago2 dissociates so slowly from extensively complementary target RNAs that essentially every fully paired target is cleaved. Conversely, mouse AGO2, which mainly mediates miRNA-directed repression, dissociates rapidly and with similar rates for fully paired and seed-matched targets.

Loss of Clec16a leads to an increase in the Nrdp1 target Parkin, a master regulator of mitophagy. Islets from mice with pancreas-specific deletion of Clec16a have abnormal mitochondria with reduced oxygen consumption and ATP concentration, both of which are required for normal β cell function. Indeed, pancreatic Clec16a is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, patients harboring a diabetogenic SNP in the Clec16a gene have reduced islet Clec16a expression and reduced insulin secretion.

In animal cells, sister chromatids gradually biorient during prometaphase, but current models of mitosis in S. cerevisiae assume that biorientation is established shortly after S phase. This assumption is based on the observation of a bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores early in mitosis and suggests fundamental differences between yeast mitosis and mitosis in animal cells. By applying super-resolution imaging methods, we show that yeast and animal cells share the key property of gradual and stochastic chromosome biorientation. The characteristic bilobed distribution of yeast kinetochores, hitherto considered synonymous for biorientation, arises from kinetochores in mixed attachment states to microtubules, the length of which discriminates bioriented from syntelic attachments.

We performed a systems-level genetic dissection of adiposity regulation using genome-wide RNAi screening in adult Drosophila. As a follow-up, the resulting ∼500 candidate obesity genes were functionally classified using muscle-, oenocyte-, fat-body-, and neuronal-specific knockdown in vivo and revealed hedgehog signaling as the top-scoring fat-body-specific pathway. To extrapolate these findings into mammals, we generated fat-specific hedgehog-activation mutant mice. Intriguingly, these mice displayed near total loss of white, but not brown, fat compartments. Mechanistically, activation of hedgehog signaling irreversibly blocked differentiation of white adipocytes through direct, coordinate modulation of early adipogenic factors.

Here, we present a selective ribosome profiling strategy that enables global monitoring of when these factors engage polypeptides in the complex cellular environment. Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone trigger factor (TF) reveal that, though TF can interact with many polypeptides, β-barrel outer-membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. Loss of TF leads to broad outer-membrane defects and premature, cotranslational protein translocation. Whereas in vitro studies suggested that TF is prebound to ribosomes waiting for polypeptides to emerge from the exit channel, we find that in vivo TF engages ribosomes only after ∼100 amino acids are translated. Moreover, excess TF interferes with cotranslational removal of the N-terminal formyl methionine. Our studies support a triaging model in which proper protein biogenesis relies on the fine-tuned, sequential engagement of processing, targeting, and folding factors.

The HIV capsid is a fullerene cone: a variably curved, closed shell composed of approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the viral CA protein. We devised methods for isolating soluble, assembly-competent CA hexamers and derived four crystallographically independent models that define the structure of this capsid assembly unit at atomic resolution. A ring of six CA N-terminal domains form an apparently rigid core, surrounded by an outer ring of C-terminal domains. Mobility of the outer ring appears to be an underlying mechanism for generating the variably curved lattice in authentic capsids. Hexamer-stabilizing interfaces are highly hydrated, and this property may be key to the formation of quasi-equivalent interactions within hexamers and pentamers.

However, long dynamin scaffolds did not produce fission: instead, fission followed GTPase-dependent cycles of assembly and disassembly of short dynamin scaffolds and involved a stochastic process dependent on the curvature stress imposed by dynamin. Fission happened spontaneously upon NT release from the scaffold, without leakage. Our calculations revealed that local narrowing of NT could induce cooperative lipid tilting, leading to self-merger of the inner monolayer of NT (hemifission), consistent with the absence of leakage.

Arf is also required with coatomer-related clathrin adaptor complexes to bud vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments. To understand the structural basis for Arf-dependent recruitment of a vesicular coat to the membrane, we determined the structure of Arf1 bound to the γζ-COP subcomplex of coatomer. Structure-guided biochemical analysis reveals that a second Arf1-GTP molecule binds to βδ-COP at a site common to the γ- and β-COP subunits. The Arf1-binding sites on coatomer are spatially related to PtdIns4,5P2-binding sites on the endocytic AP2 complex, providing evidence that the orientation of membrane binding is general for this class of vesicular coat proteins.

Myc-nick retains conserved Myc box regions but lacks nuclear localization signals and the bHLHZ domain essential for heterodimerization with Max and DNA binding. Myc-nick induces α-tubulin acetylation and altered cell morphology by recruiting histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to microtubules. During muscle differentiation, while the levels of full-length Myc diminish, Myc-nick and acetylated α-tubulin levels are increased. Ectopic expression of Myc-nick accelerates myoblast fusion, triggers the expression of myogenic markers, and permits Myc-deficient fibroblasts to transdifferentiate in response to MyoD.

We identify a microRNA exemplifying these attributes, miR-31, whose expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-31 in otherwise-aggressive breast tumor cells suppresses metastasis. We deploy a stable microRNA sponge strategy to inhibit miR-31 in vivo; this allows otherwise-nonaggressive breast cancer cells to metastasize. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR-31-mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization. Such pleiotropy is achieved via coordinate repression of a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes, including RhoA. Indeed, RhoA re-expression partially reverses miR-31-imposed metastasis suppression.

Subcellular localization of several Soj mutants indicates that Soj acts as a spatially regulated molecular switch, capable of either inhibiting or activating DnaA. We show that the classical effect of Soj inhibiting sporulation is an indirect consequence of its action on DnaA through activation of the Sda DNA replication checkpoint.

Although several cellular receptors that associate with glycoprotein D (gD), such as herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and Nectin-1, have been identified, specific molecules that mediate HSV-1 infection by associating with gB have not been elucidated. Here, we found that paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR) α associates with gB, and cells transduced with PILRα become susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection of human primary cells expressing both HVEM and PILRα was blocked by either anti-PILRα or anti-HVEM antibody. Our results demonstrate that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection and that PILRα plays an important role in HSV-1 infection as a coreceptor that associates with gB.

Here, we show that the leprosy bacterium hijacks this property to reprogram adult Schwann cells, its preferred host niche, to a stage of progenitor/stem-like cells (pSLC) of mesenchymal trait by downregulating Schwann cell lineage/differentiation- associated genes and upregulating genes mostly of mesoderm development. Reprogramming accompanies epigenetic changes and renders infected cells highly plastic, migratory, and immunomodulatory. We provide evidence that acquisition of these properties by pSLC promotes bacterial spread by two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation to mesenchymal tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscles, and formation of granuloma-like structures and subsequent release of bacteria-laden macrophages.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms that activate distinct behaviors in different castes, we exploit a natural behavioral plasticity in Harpegnathos saltator, where adult workers can transition to a reproductive, queen-like state called gamergate. Analysis of brain transcriptomes during the transition reveals that corazonin, a neuropeptide homologous to the vertebrate gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is downregulated as workers become gamergates. Corazonin is also preferentially expressed in workers and/or foragers from other social insect species. Injection of corazonin in transitioning Harpegnathos individuals suppresses expression of vitellogenin in the brain and stimulates worker-like hunting behaviors, while inhibiting gamergate behaviors, such as dueling and egg deposition.

This process is reversible and occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that Myc-depleted stem cells enter a state of dormancy similar to embryonic diapause. Indeed, c-Myc is depleted in diapaused blastocysts, and the differential expression signatures of dKO ESCs and diapaused epiblasts are remarkably similar. Following Myc inhibition, pre-implantation blastocysts enter biosynthetic dormancy but can progress through their normal developmental program after transfer into pseudo-pregnant recipients.

Together, our findings suggest that spatially defined groups of CSNs encode different movement modules, providing a logic for parallel-ordered corticospinal circuits to orchestrate multistep motor skills.

To determine the functional effect of each site, we measured the glucocorticoid (GC) responsive activity of nearly all GR binding sites (GBSs) captured using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in A549 cells. 13% of GBSs assayed had GC-induced activity. The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter-gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady-state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases.

SIRT6-deficient mice are small and at 2-3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound lymphopenia, loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, and severe metabolic defects, eventually dying at about 4 weeks.

This response requires an intact MEC1- and RAD53-dependent signaling pathway that impedes the nuclear export of intron-containing tRNA via differential relocalization of the karyopherin Los1 to the cytoplasm. The accumulation of unspliced tRNA in the nucleus signals the activation of Gcn4 transcription factor, which, in turn, contributes to cell-cycle arrest in G1 in part by delaying accumulation of the cyclin Cln2. The regulated nucleocytoplasmic tRNA trafficking thus constitutes an integral physiological adaptation to DNA damage.

Here, we report that knocking down the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (IL8RB) alleviates both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and diminishes the DNA-damage response.

To identify endogenous factors that affect the efficiency of sexual viral transmission, we screened a complex peptide/protein library derived from human semen. We show that naturally occurring fragments of the abundant semen marker prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP) form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils, termed Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI), capture HIV virions and promote their attachment to target cells, thereby enhancing the infectious virus titer by several orders of magnitude. Physiological concentrations of SEVI amplified HIV infection of T cells, macrophages, ex vivo human tonsillar tissues, and transgenic rats in vivo, as well as trans-HIV infection of T cells by dendritic or epithelial cells. Amyloidogenic PAP fragments are abundant in seminal fluid and boost semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. Thus, they may play an important role in sexual transmission of HIV and could represent new targets for its prevention. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A major question is how the liver adapts to these diurnal changes in physiology. Here, we show that, in mice, liver mass, hepatocyte size, and protein levels follow a daily rhythm, whose amplitude depends on both feeding-fasting and light-dark cycles. Correlative evidence suggests that the daily oscillation in global protein accumulation depends on a similar fluctuation in ribosome number. Whereas rRNA genes are transcribed at similar rates throughout the day, some newly synthesized rRNAs are polyadenylated and degraded in the nucleus in a robustly diurnal fashion with a phase opposite to that of ribosomal protein synthesis.

We demonstrate that a single amino-acid substitution in a banana lectin, replacing histidine 84 with a threonine, significantly reduces its mitogenicity, while preserving its broad-spectrum antiviral potency. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and glycocluster assays reveal that loss of mitogenicity is strongly correlated with loss of pi-pi stacking between aromatic amino acids H84 and Y83, which removes a wall separating two carbohydrate binding sites, thus diminishing multivalent interactions. On the other hand, monovalent interactions and antiviral activity are preserved by retaining other wild-type conformational features and possibly through unique contacts involving the T84 side chain.

In contrast, the machinery regulating exit from pluripotency is ill defined. In a large-scale small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we found that knockdown of the tumor suppressors Folliculin (Flcn) and Tsc2 prevent ESC commitment. Tsc2 lies upstream of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas Flcn acts downstream and in parallel. Flcn with its interaction partners Fnip1 and Fnip2 drives differentiation by restricting nuclear localization and activity of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3. Conversely, enforced nuclear Tfe3 enables ESCs to withstand differentiation conditions. Genome-wide location and functional analyses showed that Tfe3 directly integrates into the pluripotency circuitry through transcriptional regulation of Esrrb. These findings identify a cell-intrinsic rheostat for destabilizing ground-state pluripotency to allow lineage commitment.

Conversely, neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation in both glutamate and GABA axons.

Direct aggregation of neuroligins reveals a linkage of neuroligin-2 to GABA and glutamate postsynaptic proteins, but the other neuroligins only to glutamate postsynaptic proteins.

Single-molecule imaging reveals that GINS does not dissociate from CMG during bypass and that CMG slows dramatically after bypass, likely due to uncoupling from the stalled leading strand. The DNA helicase RTEL1 facilitates bypass, apparently by generating single-stranded DNA beyond the DPC.

The relevant ubiquitylation target was identified as budding yeast Rad17, a subunit of the PCNA-like 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp. We report here that in fact all three subunits of the 9-1-1 complex are ubiquitylated. However, in contrast to previous results, we found modification of Rad17 to be independent of DNA damage, the Rad6-Rad18 complex, the putative acceptor site (lysine 197), and loading of the complex onto DNA. Consistently, we were unable to observe enhanced damage sensitivity or defects in checkpoint signaling in a rad17(K197R) mutant.

Remarkably, and in contrast to established notions on the nature of LHRH neuronal inputs, our data identify major olfactory projection pathways originating from a discrete population of olfactory sensory neurons but fail to document any synaptic connectivity with the vomeronasal system. Accordingly, chemosensory modulation of LHRH neuronal activity and mating behavior are dramatically impaired in absence of olfactory function, while they appear unaffected in mouse mutants lacking vomeronasal signaling.

During development, fat cell precursors (i.e., preadipocytes) undergo a hypertrophic response as they mature into lipid-laden adipocytes. However, the mechanisms that regulate adipocyte size and mass remain undefined. Herein, we demonstrate that the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, coordinates adipocyte differentiation in vivo. In the absence of the protease, WAT development is aborted, leaving tissues populated by mini-adipocytes which render null mice lipodystrophic. While MT1-MMP preadipocytes display a cell autonomous defect in vivo, null progenitors retain the ability to differentiate into functional adipocytes during 2-dimensional (2-D) culture. By contrast, within the context of the 3-dimensional (3-D) ECM, normal adipocyte maturation requires a burst in MT1-MMP-mediated proteolysis that modulates pericellular collagen rigidity in a fashion that controls adipogenesis. Hence, MT1-MMP acts as a 3-D-specific adipogenic factor that directs the dynamic adipocyte-ECM interactions critical to WAT development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

While MCU alone can transport Ca2+ in primitive eukaryotes, metazoans require an essential single membrane-spanning auxiliary component called EMRE to form functional channels; however, the molecular mechanism of EMRE regulation remains elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the human MCU-EMRE complex, which defines the interactions between MCU and EMRE as well as pinpoints the juxtamembrane loop of MCU and extended linker of EMRE as the crucial elements in the EMRE-dependent gating mechanism among metazoan MCUs. The structure also features the dimerization of two MCU-EMRE complexes along an interface at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of human MCU that is a hotspot for post-translational modifications. Thus, the human MCU-EMRE complex, which constitutes the minimal channel components among metazoans, provides a framework for future mechanistic studies on MCU.

Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium.

We followed gut microbiome development from birth until age three in 222 infants in Northern Europe, where early-onset autoimmune diseases are common in Finland and Estonia but are less prevalent in Russia. We found that Bacteroides species are lowly abundant in Russians but dominate in Finnish and Estonian infants. Therefore, their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposures arose primarily from Bacteroides rather than from Escherichia coli, which is a potent innate immune activator. We show that Bacteroides LPS is structurally distinct from E. coli LPS and inhibits innate immune signaling and endotoxin tolerance; furthermore, unlike LPS from E. coli, B. dorei LPS does not decrease incidence of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.

Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1, and CACNA1H) lead to an increased clathrin binding. All three mutations create dileucine motifs known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization and restores glucose transport. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause “dileucineopathies.” Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) may serve as functional hubs to regulate protein functions.

Here we show that histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3K56Ac) is incorporated onto replicating DNA and, by increasing the binding affinity of CAF-1 and Rtt106 for histone H3, H3K56Ac enhances the ability of these histone chaperones to assemble DNA into nucleosomes. Genetic analysis indicates that H3K56Ac acts in a nonredundant manner with the acetylation of the N-terminal residues of H3 and H4 in nucleosome assembly.

However, the generality of this mechanism has remained opaque, since neither Skint1 nor DETCs are evolutionarily conserved. Here, Btnl1 expressed by murine enterocytes is shown to shape the local TCR-Vγ7+ γδ compartment. Uninfluenced by microbial or food antigens, this activity evokes the developmental selection of TCRαβ+ repertoires. Indeed, Btnl1 and Btnl6 jointly induce TCR-dependent responses specifically in intestinal Vγ7+ cells.

In yeast, COX subunit composition is regulated by COX5a and COX5b gene transcription in response to high and low O2, respectively. Here we demonstrate that in mammalian cells, expression of the COX4-1 and COX4-2 isoforms is O2 regulated. Under conditions of reduced O2 availability, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) reciprocally regulates COX4 subunit expression by activating transcription of the genes encoding COX4-2 and LON, a mitochondrial protease that is required for COX4-1 degradation. The effects of manipulating COX4 subunit expression on COX activity, ATP production, O2 consumption, and reactive oxygen species generation indicate that the COX4 subunit switch is a homeostatic response that optimizes the efficiency of respiration at different O2 concentrations. Thus, mammalian cells respond to hypoxia by altering COX subunit composition, as previously observed in yeast, but by a completely different molecular mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The fusion process has been well characterized, yet the role of coreceptor signaling remains elusive. Here, we describe a critical function of the chemokine coreceptor signaling in facilitating HIV infection of resting CD4 T cells. We find that static cortical actin in resting T cells represents a restriction and that HIV utilizes the Gαi-dependent signaling from the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 to activate a cellular actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, to overcome this restriction. HIV envelope-mediated cofilin activation and actin dynamics are important for a postentry process that leads to viral nuclear localization. Inhibition of HIV-mediated actin rearrangement markedly diminishes viral latent infection of resting T cells. Conversely, induction of active cofilin greatly facilitates it. These findings shed light on viral exploitation of cellular machinery in resting T cells, where chemokine receptor signaling becomes obligatory. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop.

However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in their 5′ UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5′ UTR m6A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5′UTR m6A. Additionally, increased m6A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m6A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5′ UTR m6A.

We show here that the serine/threonine kinase LKB1, previously implicated in the establishment of epithelial polarity and control of cell growth, is required for axon specification during neuronal polarization in the mammalian cerebral cortex. LKB1 polarizing activity requires its association with the pseudokinase Stradα and phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA and p90RSK, which transduce neurite outgrowth-promoting cues. Once activated, LKB1 phosphorylates and thereby activates SAD-A and SAD-B kinases, which are also required for neuronal polarization in the cerebral cortex. SAD kinases, in turn, phosphorylate effectors such as microtubule-associated proteins that implement polarization.

We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed “UC dysregulation” (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response. Urea cycle dysregulation (UCD) in cancer is a prevalent phenomenon in multiple cancers. UCD increases nitrogen utilization for pyrimidine synthesis, generating nucleotide imbalance that leads to detectable mutation patterns and biochemical signatures in cancer patients’ samples.

We report the structures of Sema7A and A39R complexed with the Semaphorin-binding module of PlexinC1. Both structures show two PlexinC1 molecules symmetrically bridged by Semaphorin dimers, in which the Semaphorin and PlexinC1 β propellers interact in an edge-on, orthogonal orientation. Both binding interfaces are dominated by the insertion of the Semaphorin's 4c-4d loop into a deep groove in blade 3 of the PlexinC1 propeller. A39R appears to achieve Sema7A mimicry by preserving key Plexin-binding determinants seen in the mammalian Sema7A complex that have evolved to achieve higher affinity binding to the host-derived PlexinC1.

Here we show that one of the INAD PDZ domains (PDZ5) exists in a redox-dependent equilibrium between two conformations-a reduced form that is similar to the structure of other PDZ domains, and an oxidized form in which the ligand-binding site is distorted through formation of a strong intramolecular disulfide bond. We demonstrate transient light-dependent formation of this disulfide bond in vivo and find that transgenic flies expressing a mutant INAD in which PDZ5 is locked in the reduced state display severe defects in termination of visual responses and visually mediated reflex behavior.

The deletion events were stochastic and occurred rapidly, generating dramatically shortened telomeres that were accompanied by a DNA damage response and induction of senescence. TRF2ΔB-induced deletions depended on XRCC3, a protein implicated in Holliday junction resolution, and created t-loop-sized telomeric circles. These telomeric circles were also detected in unperturbed cells and suggested that t-loop deletion by homologous recombination (HR) might contribute to telomere attrition.

One of the ways in which calcium channels regulate long-lasting neuronal properties is by activating signaling pathways that control gene expression, but the mechanisms that link calcium channels to the nucleus are not well understood. We report that a C-terminal fragment of CaV1.2, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (LTC), translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription. We show that this calcium channel associated transcription regulator (CCAT) binds to a nuclear protein, associates with an endogenous promoter, and regulates the expression of a wide variety of endogenous genes important for neuronal signaling and excitability. The nuclear localization of CCAT is regulated both developmentally and by changes in intracellular calcium.

This UV-triggered GLU synthesis promoted its packaging into synaptic vesicles and its release at glutamatergic terminals in the motor cortex and hippocampus. Related behaviors, like rotarod learning and object recognition memory, were enhanced after UV exposure. All UV-induced metabolic, electrophysiological, and behavioral effects could be reproduced by the intravenous injection of UCA and diminished by the application of inhibitor or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against urocanase, an enzyme critical for the conversion of UCA to GLU.

Significant disease components include primary myelofibrosis, leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, and vasculitis. Xist-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) show aberrant maturation and age-dependent loss. Reconstitution experiments indicate that MPN/MDS and myelofibrosis are of hematopoietic rather than stromal origin. We propose that Xist loss results in X reactivation and consequent genome-wide changes that lead to cancer, thereby causally linking the X chromosome to cancer in mice. Thus, Xist RNA not only is required to maintain XCI but also suppresses cancer in vivo. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Yildirim E.; Kirby J.E.; Brown D.E.; Mercier F.E.; Sadreyev R.I.; Scadden D.T.; Lee J.T.,64.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,9,1.0617455,0.68510944,0.6707592,1.1772215,0.45660627,0.053934198077206785,0.5035456,0.49508488,0.09070187310407063,0.6470849,0.4561665,0.10589903347870988,0.4548815,0.41217768,0.08818954603561863,0.5748643,0.34360480308532715,0.15698574483394623

We profiled ∼1.3 million cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these two brain structures.",cell type; cortex; excitatory neuron; GABAergic; glutamatergic; hippocampus; interneuron; single-cell RNA sequencing; single-cell transcriptomics,Yao Z.; van Velthoven C.T.J.; Nguyen T.N.; Goldy J.; Sedeno-Cortes A.E.; Baftizadeh F.; Bertagnolli D.; Casper T.; Chiang M.; Crichton K.; Ding S.-L.; Fong O.; Garren E.; Glandon A.; Gouwens N.W.; Gray J.; Graybuck L.T.; Hawrylycz M.J.; Hirschstein D.; Kroll M.; Lathia K.; Lee C.; Levi B.; McMillen D.; Mok S.; Pham T.; Ren Q.; Rimorin C.; Shapovalova N.; Sulc J.; Sunkin S.M.; Tieu M.; Torkelson A.; Tung H.; Ward K.; Dee N.; Smith K.A.; Tasic B.; Zeng H.,79.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2021,8,0.57194704,0.43077946,0.44124484,0.5112288,0.47822773,0.09203754584990914,0.4533919,0.44721293,0.07287868959973443,0.5518542,0.4443972,0.10156784476531178,0.60689044,0.4517361,0.09349704569742096,0.5709099,0.4072897434234619,-0.06670428812503815

In Paramecium development, two classes of sRNAs that are required for DNA elimination are produced by three Dicer-like enzymes: Dcl2, Dcl3, and Dcl5. Through in vitro cleavage assays, we demonstrate that Dcl2 has a strict size preference for 25 nt and a sequence preference for 5′ U and 5′ AGA, while Dcl3 has a sequence preference for 5′ UNG. Dcl5, however, has cleavage preferences for 5′ UAG and 3′ CUAC/UN, which leads to the production of RNAs precisely matching short excised DNA elements with corresponding end base preferences.

Although the prelimbic cortex (PL, part of medial prefrontal cortex) has been implicated in social behavior, it is not clear which neurons are relevant or how they contribute.

Activation of NAc-projecting PL neurons (PL-NAc), but not the other subpopulations, decreased the preference for a social target. To determine what information PL-NAc neurons convey, we selectively recorded from them and found that individual neurons were active during social investigation, but only in specific spatial locations. Spatially specific manipulation of these neurons bidirectionally regulated the formation of a social-spatial association.

Analyses of genetic interactions with the ESCRT machinery as well as chimeric ubiquitinated synaptic vesicle proteins indicate that endosomal trafficking facilitates the replacement of dysfunctional synaptic vesicle components. Consequently, sky mutants harbor a larger readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and show a dramatic increase in basal neurotransmitter release.

We repeat actions with known consequences. But we also draw on loosely related events to infer and imagine the outcome of entirely novel choices. These inferential decisions are thought to engage a number of brain regions; however, the underlying neuronal computation remains unknown. Here, we use a multi-day cross-species approach in humans and mice to report the functional anatomy and neuronal computation underlying inferential decisions. We show that during successful inference, the mammalian brain uses a hippocampal prospective code to forecast temporally structured learned associations. Moreover, during resting behavior, coactivation of hippocampal cells in sharp-wave/ripples represent inferred relationships that include reward, thereby “joining-the-dots” between events that have not been observed together but lead to profitable outcomes.

Recent studies in Drosophila revealed a potential link between Merlin and the Hippo pathway by placing Merlin genetically upstream of the kinase Hpo/Mst. In contrast to the commonly depicted linear model of Merlin functioning through Hpo/Mst, here we show that in both Drosophila and mammals, Merlin promotes downstream Hippo signaling without activating the intrinsic kinase activity of Hpo/Mst. Instead, Merlin directly binds and recruits the effector kinase Wts/Lats to the plasma membrane. Membrane recruitment, in turn, promotes Wts phosphorylation by the Hpo-Sav kinase complex. We further show that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton promotes Merlin-Wts interactions, which implicates Merlin in actin-mediated regulation of Hippo signaling.

Inhibition of NF-κB activation increases susceptibility to TNFα-induced death, concurrent with sustained JNK activation, an important contributor to the death response. Sustained JNK activation in NF-κB-deficient cells was suggested to depend on reactive oxygen species (ROS), but how ROS affect JNK activation was unclear. We now show that TNFα-induced ROS, whose accumulation is suppressed by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cause oxidation and inhibition of JNK-inactivating phosphatases by converting their catalytic cysteine to sulfenic acid. This results in sustained JNK activation, which is required for cytochrome c release and caspase 3 cleavage, as well as necrotic cell death. Treatment of cells or experimental animals with an antioxidant prevents H2O2 accumulation, JNK phosphatase oxidation, sustained JNK activity, and both forms of cell death.

Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption has also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, suggesting a shared mechanism by which protein stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we show that cellular stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport by localizing critical nucleocytoplasmic transport factors into stress granules, RNA/protein complexes that play a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis. Importantly, inhibiting stress granule assembly, such as by knocking down Ataxin-2, suppresses nucleocytoplasmic transport defects as well as neurodegeneration in C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD. Our findings identify a link between stress granule assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport, two fundamental cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell polarization. First, using a coarse-grained computational model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve polarization. All solutions contained one of three minimal motifs: positive feedback, mutual inhibition, or inhibitor with positive feedback. These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited conditions; circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more robust. With these design principles as a blueprint, we experimentally constructed artificial polarization networks in yeast, using a toolkit of chimeric signaling proteins that spatially direct the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).

Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic screening we show that the basal transcription factor TFIID directly binds to the H3K4me3 mark via the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of TAF3. Selective loss of H3K4me3 reduces transcription from and TFIID binding to a subset of promoters in vivo. Equilibrium binding assays and competition experiments show that the TAF3 PHD finger is highly selective for H3K4me3. In transient assays, TAF3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator in a PHD finger-dependent manner. Interestingly, asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 selectively inhibits TFIID binding to H3K4me3, whereas acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates TFIID interaction.

The most common resistance mechanism is amplification of this locus presumably targeting the AR gene. Here, we identify and characterize a somatically acquired AR enhancer located 650 kb centromeric to the AR. Systematic perturbation of this enhancer using genome editing decreased proliferation by suppressing AR levels. Insertion of an additional copy of this region sufficed to increase proliferation under low androgen conditions and to decrease sensitivity to enzalutamide. Epigenetic data generated in localized prostate tumors and benign specimens support the notion that this region is a developmental enhancer. Collectively, these observations underscore the importance of epigenomic profiling in primary specimens and the value of deploying genome editing to functionally characterize noncoding elements. More broadly, this work identifies a therapeutic vulnerability for targeting the AR and emphasizes the importance of regulatory elements as highly recurrent oncogenic drivers.

Notably, pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) are characterized by high mutation rates. We hypothesize that hypermutability is a property of ASD genes and may also include nucleotide-substitution hot spots. We investigated global patterns of germline mutation by whole-genome sequencing of monozygotic twins concordant for ASD and their parents. Mutation rates varied widely throughout the genome (by 100-fold) and could be explained by intrinsic characteristics of DNA sequence and chromatin structure. Dense clusters of mutations within individual genomes were attributable to compound mutation or gene conversion. Hypermutability was a characteristic of genes involved in ASD and other diseases. In addition, genes impacted by mutations in this study were associated with ASD in independent exome-sequencing data sets. Our findings suggest that regional hypermutation is a significant factor shaping patterns of genetic variation and disease risk in humans.

Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

DNA breaks in IgH leading to c-myc/IgH translocations are created by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) during antibody class switch recombination or somatic hypermutation. However, the source of DNA breaks at c-myc is not known. Here, we provide evidence for the c-myc promoter region being required in targeting AID-mediated DNA damage to produce DSBs in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations in primary B lymphocytes.

Direct proof is still lacking, mainly because of our poor understanding of the biological differences between normal and cancer stem cells (SCs). Using the ErbB2 transgenic model of breast cancer, we found that self-renewing divisions of cancer SCs are more frequent than their normal counterparts, unlimited and symmetric, thus contributing to increasing numbers of SCs in tumoral tissues. SCs with targeted mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 possess the same self-renewal properties as cancer SCs, and their number increases progressively in the p53 null premalignant mammary gland. Pharmacological reactivation of p53 correlates with restoration of asymmetric divisions in cancer SCs and tumor growth reduction, without significant effects on additional cancer cells.

We report the discovery that striatal astrocytes drive such phenotypes through a hitherto unknown synaptic mechanism. We found that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) triggered astrocyte signaling via γ-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptors. Selective chemogenetic activation of this pathway in striatal astrocytes in vivo resulted in acute behavioral hyperactivity and disrupted attention. Such responses also resulted in upregulation of the synaptogenic cue thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in astrocytes, increased excitatory synapses, enhanced corticostriatal synaptic transmission, and increased MSN action potential firing in vivo.

Here, we uncover a distinct pathway of telomere-driven genome instability, specifically occurring in cells that maintain telomeres with the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism. We show that, in these cells, telomeric DNA is added to multiple discrete sites throughout the genome, corresponding to regions regulated by NR2C/F transcription factors. These proteins drive local telomere DNA addition by recruiting telomeric chromatin. This mechanism, which we name targeted telomere insertion (TTI), generates potential common fragile sites that destabilize the genome.

Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading the condensation signal to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles.

Nuclear import rates correlated with nuclear size, and varying the concentrations of two transport factors, importin α and Ntf2, was sufficient to account for nuclear scaling between the two species. Both factors modulated lamin B3 import, with importin α increasing overall import rates and Ntf2 reducing import based on cargo size.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains many duplicated genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Prior studies have suggested that these duplicated proteins are functionally redundant and affect cellular processes in proportion to their expression. In contrast, through studies of ASH1 mRNA in yeast, we demonstrate paralog-specific requirements for the translation of localized mRNAs. Intriguingly, these paralog-specific effects are limited to a distinct subset of duplicated ribosomal proteins. Moreover, transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of cells lacking specific ribosomal proteins reveals differences between the functional roles of ribosomal protein paralogs that extend beyond effects on mRNA localization. Finally, we show that ribosomal protein paralogs exhibit differential requirements for assembly and localization. Together, our data indicate complex specialization of ribosomal proteins for specific cellular processes and support the existence of a ribosomal code. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In zebrafish, retinal ganglion cells project their axons into at least six layers within the neuropil of the midbrain tectum. Each axon elaborates a single, planar arbor in one of the target layers and forms synapses onto the dendrites of tectal neurons. We show that the laminar specificity of retinotectal connections does not depend on self-sorting interactions among RGC axons. Rather, tectum-derived Slit1, signaling through axonal Robo2, guides neurites to their target layer. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that Slit binds to Dragnet (Col4a5), a type IV Collagen, which forms the basement membrane on the surface of the tectum. We further show that radial glial endfeet are required for the basement-membrane anchoring of Slit.

The migration phase is driven by PKCθ, which is localized to the F-actin-dependent peripheral (p)SMAC. PKCθ-/- T cells formed hyperstable IS in vitro and in vivo and, like WT cells, displayed fast oscillations in the distal SMAC, but they showed reduced slow oscillations in pSMAC integrity. IS reformation is driven by the Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp). WASp-/- T cells displayed normal IS formation but were unable to reform IS after migration unless PKCθ was inhibited.

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets from human, non-human primate, and mouse barrier tissues identifies putative cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.

The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7–targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.

In many infectious diseases, antibodies (Abs) are powerful biomarkers and important immune mediators. However, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, a discriminatory or protective role for humoral immunity remains unclear. Using an unbiased antibody profiling approach, we show that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (Ltb) and active tuberculosis disease (Atb) have distinct Mtb-specific humoral responses, such that Ltb infection is associated with unique Ab Fc functional profiles, selective binding to FcγRIII, and distinct Ab glycosylation patterns. Moreover, compared to Abs from Atb, Abs from Ltb drove enhanced phagolysosomal maturation, inflammasome activation, and, most importantly, macrophage killing of intracellular Mtb. Combined, these data point to a potential role for Fc-mediated Ab effector functions, tuned via differential glycosylation, in Mtb control.",antibodies; Fc-receptors; inflammasome; innate immunity; tuberculosis,Lu L.L.; Chung A.W.; Rosebrock T.R.; Ghebremichael M.; Yu W.H.; Grace P.S.; Schoen M.K.; Tafesse F.; Martin C.; Leung V.; Mahan A.E.; Sips M.; Kumar M.P.; Tedesco J.; Robinson H.; Tkachenko E.; Draghi M.; Freedberg K.J.; Streeck H.; Suscovich T.J.; Lauffenburger D.A.; Restrepo B.I.; Day C.; Fortune S.M.; Alter G.,94.0,726777956.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.81210876,0.47371984,0.52880704,0.8010911,0.37430334,0.02838109573257197,0.38061658,0.503637,0.097253051429256,0.6451356,0.51582915,0.11673061703238335,0.47482222,0.45131862,0.09341359369378999,0.63057584,0.11768627911806107,-0.11227696388959885

However, the protein products of oncogenes are sometimes overexpressed without alteration of the proto-oncogene. Helping to explain this phenomenon, we found that when compared to similarly proliferating nontransformed cell lines, cancer cell lines often expressed substantial amounts of mRNA isoforms with shorter 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). These shorter isoforms usually resulted from alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). The APA had functional consequences, with the shorter mRNA isoforms exhibiting increased stability and typically producing ten-fold more protein, in part through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression. Moreover, expression of the shorter mRNA isoform of the proto-oncogene IGF2BP1/IMP-1 led to far more oncogenic transformation than did expression of the full-length, annotated mRNA. The high incidence of APA in cancer cells, with consequent loss of 3′UTR repressive elements, suggests a pervasive role for APA in oncogene activation without genetic alteration. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Hybridization tests using D. melanogaster deficiencies that include tan show no evidence that this locus is involved in the lighter pigmentation of D. santomea females; rather, the pigmentation difference appears to involve at least four other loci in the region.

The physicochemical underpinnings of this temperature-sensitive gating have proven difficult to parse. Here, we took a bottom-up protein design approach and rationally engineered ion channels to activate in response to thermal stimuli. By varying amino acid polarities at sites undergoing state-dependent changes in solvation, we were able to systematically confer temperature sensitivity to a canonical voltage-gated ion channel. Our results imply that the specific heat capacity change during channel gating is a major determinant of thermosensitive gating. We also show that reduction of gating charges amplifies temperature sensitivity of designer channels, which accounts for low-voltage sensitivity in all known temperature-gated ion channels. These emerging principles suggest a plausible molecular mechanism for temperature-dependent gating that reconcile how ion channels with an overall conserved transmembrane architecture may exhibit a wide range of temperature-sensing phenotypes.

Although neurons can release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth.

We show that, for the first 5 min of copulation in Drosophila, stressful stimuli do not interrupt mating, whereas 10 min later, even minor perturbations are sufficient to terminate copulation. This decline in persistence occurs as the probability of successful mating increases and is promoted by approximately eight sexually dimorphic, GABAergic interneurons of the male abdominal ganglion. When these interneurons were silenced, persistence increased and males copulated far longer than required for successful mating. When these interneurons were stimulated, persistence decreased and copulations were shortened. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons of the ventral nerve cord promote copulation persistence and extend copulation duration.

Specifically, we show that FMRP binds chromatin through its tandem Tudor (Agenet) domain in vitro and associates with chromatin in vivo. We also demonstrate that FMRP participates in the DDR in a chromatin-binding-dependent manner. The DDR machinery is known to play important roles in developmental processes such as gametogenesis.

This beige APC population is proliferative and marked by cell-surface proteins, including PDGFRα, Sca1, and CD81.

We used live-cell imaging to investigate the role of p53 dynamics in fractional killing of colon cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that both surviving and dying cells reach similar levels of p53, indicating that cell death is not determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Instead, a cell's probability of death depends on the time and levels of p53. Cells must reach a threshold level of p53 to execute apoptosis, and this threshold increases with time.

Here we show that in zebrafish oogenesis, a group of cells within the granulosa cell layer at the oocyte animal pole acquire elevated levels of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ in their nuclei. One of these cells, the future micropyle precursor cell (MPC), accumulates increasingly high levels of nuclear TAZ and grows faster than its surrounding cells, mechanically compressing those cells, which ultimately lose TAZ from their nuclei. Strikingly, relieving neighbor-cell compression by MPC ablation or aspiration restores nuclear TAZ accumulation in neighboring cells, eventually leading to MPC re-specification from these cells. Conversely, MPC specification is defective in taz−/− follicles. These findings uncover a novel mode of lateral inhibition in cell fate specification based on mechanical signals controlling TAZ activity.

Structurally critical mutations in the canonical EF-hand, ""hidden"" EF-hand, or SAM domain disrupt Ca2+ sensitivity in oligomerization via destabilization of the entire EF-SAM entity. In mammalian cells, EF-SAM destabilization mutations within full-length STIM1 induce punctae formation and activate SOCE independent of luminal Ca2+. We provide atomic resolution insight into the molecular basis for STIM1-mediated SOCE initiation and show that the folded/unfolded state of the Ca2+-sensing region of STIM is crucial to SOCE regulation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, at non-lethal doses, cancer cells can choose to remain proliferative or become senescent. The slow development of senescence makes studying this decision challenging. Here, by analyzing single-cell p21 dynamics before, during, and days after drug treatment, we link three distinct patterns of early p21 dynamics to final cell fate. Surprisingly, while high p21 expression is classically associated with senescence, we find the opposite at early times during drug treatment: most senescence-fated cells express much lower p21 levels than proliferation-fated cells. We demonstrate that these dynamics lead to a p21 “Goldilocks zone” for proliferation, in which modest increases of p21 expression can lead to an undesirable increase of cancer cell proliferation. Our study identifies a counter-intuitive role for early p21 dynamics in the cell-fate decision and pinpoints a source of proliferative cancer cells that can emerge after exposure to non-lethal doses of chemotherapy. The proliferation-senescence cell-fate decision after drug treatment is determined by three distinct patterns of p21 dynamics. Either a delayed or acute drug-induced p21 response leads to a senescence fate, while an intermediate pulse of p21 response leads to a proliferation fate. This relation between p21 dynamics and cell fate creates a p21 “Goldilocks zone” that favors cell proliferation after drug treatment.",cell tracking; cell-fate decision; p21; senescence,Hsu C.-H.; Altschuler S.J.; Wu L.F.,82.0,735976959.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2019,8,0.51821196,0.3613618,0.37386867,0.52180487,0.47151875,0.08466696155886788,0.45428428,0.3315041,0.053258640830662896,0.6934904,0.42064083,0.08955360841359511,0.40095243,0.19138265,-0.0033956662117887726,0.50462157,-0.08037033677101135,-0.14697225391864777

In the crystal structures of several SYG-1 and SYG-2 orthologs and their complexes, we find that SYG-1 orthologs homodimerize through a common, bispecific interface that similarly mediates an unusual orthogonal docking geometry in the heterophilic SYG-1/SYG-2 complex. C. elegans SYG-1's specification of proper synapse formation in vivo closely correlates with the heterophilic complex affinity, which appears to be tuned for optimal function. Furthermore, replacement of the interacting domains of SYG-1 and SYG-2 with those from CAM complexes that assume alternative docking geometries or the introduction of segmental flexibility compromised synaptic function.

Activation of these neurons promotes sugar consumption and restricts water consumption, whereas inactivation promotes water consumption and restricts sugar consumption. By calcium imaging studies, we show that these neurons are directly regulated by a hormone signal of nutrient levels and by osmolality. Finally, we identify a hormone receptor and an osmolality-sensitive ion channel that underlie this regulation.

Cps 35 is required for COMPASS' catalytic activity in vivo, and the addition of exogenous purified Cps35 to COMPASS purified from a Δrad6 background results in the generation of a methylation competent COMPASS. Cps35 associates with the chromatin of COMPASS-regulated genes in a H2BK123 monoubiquitination-dependent but Set1-independent manner. Cps35 is also required for proper H3K79 trimethylation.

Many transposons, such as Mu, Tn7, and IS21, require regulatory AAA+ ATPases for function. We use X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to show that the ATPase subunit of IS21, IstB, assembles into a clamshell-shaped decamer that sandwiches DNA between two helical pentamers of ATP-associated AAA+ domains, sharply bending the duplex into a 180° U-turn. Biochemical studies corroborate key features of the structure and further show that the IS21 transposase, IstA, recognizes the IstB•DNA complex and promotes its disassembly by stimulating ATP hydrolysis.

We now report that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) isoform MOR1D is essential for morphine-induced scratching (MIS), whereas the isoform MOR1 is required only for morphine-induced analgesia (MIA). MOR1D heterodimerizes with gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in the spinal cord, relaying itch information. We show that morphine triggers internalization of both GRPR and MOR1D, whereas GRP specifically triggers GRPR internalization and morphine-independent scratching. Providing potential insight into opioid-induced itch prevention, we demonstrate that molecular and pharmacologic inhibition of PLCβ3 and IP3R3, downstream effectors of GRPR, specifically block MIS but not MIA.

Initially distributed throughout the ooplasm, MTOCs congress at the center of the oocyte, where they contribute to a massive, Ran-dependent increase of the number of microtubules after nuclear envelope breakdown and to the individualization of clustered chromosomes. Through progressive MTOC clustering and activation of kinesin-5, the multipolar MTOC aggregate self-organizes into a bipolar intermediate, which then elongates and thereby establishes chromosome biorientation.

Significantly, recombinant YY1 is sufficient to induce Hdm2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination in vitro, suggesting that this function of YY1 is independent of its transcriptional activity. We identify direct physical interactions of YY1 with Hdm2 and p53 and show that the basis for YY1-regulating p53 ubiquitination is its ability to facilitate Hdm2-p53 interaction. Importantly, the tumor suppressor p14 ARF compromises the Hdm2-YY1 interaction, which is important for YY1 regulation of p53.

We identified a novel BTB-zinc finger protein, named Chinmo (Chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis), that governs neuronal temporal identity during postembryonic development of the Drosophila brain. In both MB and PN lineages, loss of Chinmo autonomously causes early-born neurons to adopt the fates of late-born neurons from the same lineages. Interestingly, primarily due to a posttranscriptional control, MB neurons born at early developmental stages contain more abundant Chinmo than their later-born siblings. Further, the temporal identity of MB progeny can be transformed toward earlier or later fates by reducing or increasing Chinmo levels, respectively. Taken together, we suggest that a temporal gradient of Chinmo (Chinmohigh → Chinmolow) helps specify distinct birth order-dependent cell fates in an extended neuronal lineage. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Open chromatin fibers correlate with regions of highest gene density, but not with gene expression since inactive genes can be in domains of open chromatin, and active genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin fibers. Moreover, we show that chromatin fiber structure impacts on further levels of chromatin condensation.

By using a conditional SIRT6 allele, we show that SIRT6 deletion in vivo increases the number, size, and aggressiveness of tumors. SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolism by corepressing MYC transcriptional activity. Lastly, Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers, and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates, highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancer metabolism.

Exit of cholesterol from lysosomes requires two proteins, membrane-bound Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and soluble NPC2. NPC2 binds cholesterol with its isooctyl side chain buried and its 3β-hydroxyl exposed. Here, we describe high-resolution structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1 and complexes with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. NPC1(NTD) binds cholesterol in an orientation opposite to NPC2: 3β-hydroxyl buried and isooctyl side chain exposed. Cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) requires reorientation of a helical subdomain in NPC1(NTD), enlarging the opening for cholesterol entry. NPC1 with point mutations in this subdomain (distinct from the binding subdomain) cannot accept cholesterol from NPC2 and cannot restore cholesterol exit from lysosomes in NPC1-deficient cells. We propose a working model wherein after lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters, cholesterol binds NPC2, which transfers it to NPC1(NTD), reversing its orientation and allowing insertion of its isooctyl side chain into the outer lysosomal membranes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Sexual differentiation is essential for this process, as only sexual parasites, called gametocytes, are infective to the mosquito vector. Gametocyte production rates vary depending on environmental conditions, but external stimuli remain obscure. Here, we show that the host-derived lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) controls P. falciparum cell fate by repressing parasite sexual differentiation. We demonstrate that exogenous LysoPC drives biosynthesis of the essential membrane component phosphatidylcholine. LysoPC restriction induces a compensatory response, linking parasite metabolism to the activation of sexual-stage-specific transcription and gametocyte formation. Our results reveal that malaria parasites can sense and process host-derived physiological signals to regulate differentiation. These data close a critical knowledge gap in parasite biology and introduce a major component of the sexual differentiation pathway in Plasmodium that may provide new approaches for blocking malaria transmission.

Furthermore, by modulating QKI levels, we show the effect on circRNA abundance is dependent on intronic QKI binding motifs.

We show that these responses emerge from the geometry of branched actin: when load per filament decreases, elongation speed increases and perpendicular filaments gradually outcompete others because they polymerize the shortest distance to the membrane, where they are protected from capping.

We hypothesize that decoding occurs by modulation of signaling through changes in plasma membrane curvature. Using analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we studied how elongation of cell shape affects plasma membrane signaling. Mathematical analyses reveal transient accumulation of activated receptors at regions of higher curvature with increasing cell eccentricity. This distribution of activated receptors is periodic, following the Mathieu function, and it arises from local imbalance between reaction and diffusion of soluble ligands and receptors in the plane of the membrane. Numerical simulations show that transient microdomains of activated receptors amplify signals to downstream protein kinases. For growth factor receptor pathways, increasing cell eccentricity elevates the levels of activated cytoplasmic Src and nuclear MAPK1,2. These predictions were experimentally validated by changing cellular eccentricity, showing that shape is a locus of retrievable information storage in cells. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Rangamani P.; Lipshtat A.; Azeloglu E.U.; Calizo R.C.; Hu M.; Ghassemi S.; Hone J.; Scarlata S.; Neves S.R.; Iyengar R.,60.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,9,0.67532957,0.5149912,0.5293414,0.6857107,0.29966497,0.037309471909023506,0.3210968,0.47594273,0.0824820646821664,0.4791784,0.5070442,0.10815710333832351,0.4589565,0.49381757,0.11473070963796955,0.6202758,0.22227919101715088,0.23562504351139069

Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression.

Here, we show that the protein FCHSD2 is a major activator of actin polymerization during CME. FCHSD2 deletion leads to decreased ligand uptake caused by slowed pit maturation. FCHSD2 is recruited to endocytic pits by the scaffold protein intersectin via an unusual SH3-SH3 interaction.

Lack of Sir2 along with calorie restriction and/or mutations in the yeast AKT homolog, Sch9, or Ras pathways causes a dramatic chronological life-span extension. Inactivation of Sir2 causes uptake and catabolism of ethanol and upregulation of many stress-resistance and sporulation genes. These changes while sufficient to extend chronological life span in wild-type yeast require severe calorie restriction or additional mutations to extend life span of sir2Δ mutants.

Using arrhythmic Bmal1-null mice, we generated animals with reconstituted circadian expression of BMAL1 exclusively in the liver (Liver-RE). High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics show that the liver has independent circadian functions specific for metabolic processes such as the NAD+ salvage pathway and glycogen turnover. However, although BMAL1 occupies chromatin at most genomic targets in Liver-RE mice, circadian expression is restricted to ∼10% of normally rhythmic transcripts.

Here, we show that a catabolite of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), namely phaseic acid (PA), likely emerged in seed plants as a signaling molecule that fine-tunes plant physiology, environmental adaptation, and development. This trait was facilitated by both the emergence-selection of a PA reductase that modulates PA concentrations and by the functional diversification of the ABA receptor family to perceive and respond to PA.

Here, we develop a chemical biology approach to determine mammalian nucleosome positions genome-wide. We uncovered surprising features of nucleosome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the prevailing model, we observe that for nearly all mouse genes, a class of fragile nucleosomes occupies previously designated nucleosome-depleted regions around transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. We show that nucleosomes occupy DNA targets for a subset of DNA-binding proteins, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and pluripotency factors. Furthermore, we provide evidence that promoter-proximal nucleosomes, with the +1 nucleosome in particular, contribute to the pausing of RNA polymerase II. Lastly, we find a characteristic preference for nucleosomes at exon-intron junctions.

Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine.

Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas. Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1 deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression.

Recently, Ras-induced macropinocytosis of extracellular proteins was shown to reduce a transformed cell's dependence on extracellular glutamine. Here, we demonstrate that protein macropinocytosis can also serve as an essential amino acid source. Lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins can sustain cell survival and induce activation of mTORC1 but fails to elicit significant cell accumulation. Unlike its growth-promoting activity under amino-acid-replete conditions, we discovered that mTORC1 activation suppresses proliferation when cells rely on extracellular proteins as an amino acid source. Inhibiting mTORC1 results in increased catabolism of endocytosed proteins and enhances cell proliferation during nutrient-depleted conditions in vitro and within vascularly compromised tumors in vivo. Thus, by preventing nutritional consumption of extracellular proteins, mTORC1 couples growth to availability of free amino acids.

First, rapid heterochromatin-mediated mechanosensing, independent of known cellular mechanosensors, drives calcium-dependent nuclear softening. If the mechanical stress persists, a second, tissue-level reorganization occurs, mediated by cell-cell contacts to redistribute mechanical energy to prevent force transmission to the nucleus. © 2020 The Author(s)Tissue homeostasis requires maintenance of functional integrity under stress. A central source of stress is mechanical force that acts on cells, their nuclei, and chromatin, but how the genome is protected against mechanical stress is unclear. We show that mechanical stretch deforms the nucleus, which cells initially counteract via a calcium-dependent nuclear softening driven by loss of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. The resulting changes in chromatin rheology and architecture are required to insulate genetic material from mechanical force. Failure to mount this nuclear mechanoresponse results in DNA damage. Persistent, high-amplitude stretch induces supracellular alignment of tissue to redistribute mechanical energy before it reaches the nucleus. This tissue-scale mechanoadaptation functions through a separate pathway mediated by cell-cell contacts and allows cells/tissues to switch off nuclear mechanotransduction to restore initial chromatin state.

Each contains an extrahelical template nucleotide upstream of the active site. Surprisingly, the extra nucleotide, even when combined with an adjacent mismatch, does not perturb polymerase active site geometry, which is indistinguishable from that for correctly aligned strands.

The protein plays a very important role in early organ development. In the present study, we characterized the tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 under platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. We demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 at Y593 mediated PDGF-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We showed that PDGF treatment led to phosphorylation of p68 at Y593 in the cell nucleus. The Y593-phosphorylated p68 (referred to as phosphor-p68) promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation via a Wnt-independent pathway. The phosphor-p68 facilitates β-catenin nuclear translocation by blocking phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β and displacing Axin from β-catenin. The β-catenin nuclear translocation and subsequent interaction with the LEF/TCF was required for the EMT process.

However, the structural and mechanistic features that enable template-independent processive chain synthesis are unknown.

These properties are enabled by rapid association driven by electrostatic interactions between the acidic tail of Cdc34 and a basic 'canyon' in the Cul1 subunit of SCF. Ab initio docking between Cdc34 and Cul1 predicts intimate contact between the tail and the basic canyon, an arrangement confirmed by crosslinking and kinetic analysis of mutants. Basic canyon residues are conserved in both Cul1 paralogs and orthologs, suggesting that the same mechanism underlies processivity for all cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.

These changes in light quality trigger a series of responses known collectively as the shade avoidance syndrome. During shade avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf and storage organ expansion, branching is inhibited, and flowering is accelerated. We identified several loci in Arabidopsis, mutations in which lead to plants defective in multiple shade avoidance responses. Here we describe TAA1, an aminotransferase, and show that TAA1 catalyzes the formation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) from L-tryptophan (L-Trp), the first step in a previously proposed, but uncharacterized, auxin biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is rapidly deployed to synthesize auxin at the high levels required to initiate the multiple changes in body plan associated with shade avoidance. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One pathway that restricts viral infection in plants and insects is RNA interference (RNAi), which targets and degrades viral RNA to limit infection. To identify additional genes involved in intrinsic antiviral immunity, we screened Drosophila cells for modulators of viral infection using an RNAi library. We identified Ars2 as a key component of Drosophila antiviral immunity. Loss of Ars2 in cells, or in flies, increases susceptibility to RNA viruses. Consistent with its antiviral properties, we found that Ars2 physically interacts with Dcr-2, modulates its activity in vitro, and is required for siRNA-mediated silencing. Furthermore, we show that Ars2 plays an essential role in miRNA-mediated silencing, interacting with the Microprocessor and stabilizing pri-miRNAs.

A truncated form of CLASP1 lacking the kinetochore binding domain behaves as a dominant negative, leading to the formation of radial arrays of microtubule bundles that are highly resistant to depolymerization. Microinjection of CLASP1-specific antibodies suppresses microtubule dynamics at kinetochores and throughout the spindle, resulting in the formation of monopolar asters with chromosomes buried in the interior.

Currently, we cannot explain how this dynamic structure generates and responds to forces while maintaining overall stability, as we have a poor understanding of its micromechanical properties. Here, we combine the use of force-calibrated needles, high-resolution microscopy, and biochemical perturbations to analyze the vertebrate metaphase spindle's timescale- and orientation-dependent viscoelastic properties. We find that spindle viscosity depends on microtubule crosslinking and density. Spindle elasticity can be linked to kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubule rigidity, and also to spindle pole organization by kinesin-5 and dynein. These data suggest a quantitative model for the micromechanics of this cytoskeletal architecture and provide insight into how structural and functional stability is maintained in the face of forces, such as those that control spindle size and position, and can result from deformations associated with chromosome movement.

Deficiency of mammalian SIRT6 leads to shortened life span and an aging-like phenotype in mice, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear.

In SIRT6-deficient cells, hyperacetylation of H3K9 at these target promoters is associated with increased RELA promoter occupancy and enhanced NF-κB-dependent modulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Computational genomics analyses revealed increased activity of NF-κB-driven gene expression programs in multiple Sirt6-deficient tissues in vivo. Moreover, haploinsufficiency of RelA rescues the early lethality and degenerative syndrome of Sirt6-deficient mice.

Cut8 is an Rhp6 substrate that physically interacts with and tethers proteasome. Nonubiquitinatable K-all-R Cut8 weakly interacts with proteasome and fails to enrich nuclear proteasome. Consistently, the nuclear enrichment of proteasome also fails in rhp6 and ubr1 null mutants. Further, cut8 null and cut8 K-all-R mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage, probably due to the paucity of nuclear proteasome. Thus, Rhp6 enhances the retention of nuclear proteasome through regulating Cut8. The short-lived nature of Cut8 is crucial for feedback enrichment of the proteasome within the nucleus. This is likely to be a conserved mechanism as we describe a Cut8 homolog in flies.

Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity.",,Rooney M.S.; Shukla S.A.; Wu C.J.; Getz G.; Hacohen N.,78.0,725315826.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,1.3144171,0.4540242,0.55771875,1.7511566,0.46876788,0.06485581492291603,0.5914251,0.494565,0.08031841282415397,0.69084144,0.37627125,0.07193200523724791,0.5718038,0.42666352,0.05252204888914341,0.41728488,0.4239640235900879,-0.13546286523342133

One such system is the Bacillus subtilis phage φ29 DNA packaging motor, which generates large forces to compact its genome into a small protein capsid. Here we use optical tweezers to study, at the single-molecule level, the mechanism of force generation in this motor. We determine the kinetic parameters of the packaging motor and their dependence on external load to show that DNA translocation does not occur during ATP binding but is likely triggered by phosphate release. We also show that the motor subunits act in a coordinated, successive fashion with high processivity. Finally, we propose a minimal mechanochemical cycle of this DNA-translocating ATPase that rationalizes all of our findings.

Interestingly, the two conditions do not always coincide and the molecular determinants of ""healthy"" versus ""unhealthy"" obesity remain ill-defined. Chronic metabolic inflammation (metaflammation) is believed to be pivotal. Here, we tested a hypothesized anti-inflammatory role for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the development of metabolic disease. Surprisingly, in matched biopsies from ""healthy"" versus insulin-resistant obese subjects we find HO-1 to be among the strongest positive predictors of metabolic disease in humans. We find that hepatocyte and macrophage conditional HO-1 deletion in mice evokes resistance to diet-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, dramatically reducing secondary disease such as steatosis and liver toxicity. Intriguingly, cellular assays show that HO-1 defines prestimulation thresholds for inflammatory skewing and NF-κB amplification in macrophages and for insulin signaling in hepatocytes. These findings identify HO-1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Jais A.; Einwallner E.; Sharif O.; Gossens K.; Lu T.T.-H.; Soyal S.M.; Medgyesi D.; Neureiter D.; Paier-Pourani J.; Dalgaard K.; Duvigneau J.C.; Lindroos-Christensen J.; Zapf T.-C.; Amann S.; Saluzzo S.; Jantscher F.; Stiedl P.; Todoric J.; Martins R.; Oberkofler H.; Muller S.; Hauser-Kronberger C.; Kenner L.; Casanova E.; Sutterluty-Fall H.; Bilban M.; Miller K.; Kozlov A.V.; Krempler F.; Knapp S.; Lumeng C.N.; Patsch W.; Wagner O.; Pospisilik J.A.; Esterbauer H.,77.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,7,0.6102695,0.5839754,0.5606612,0.69893235,0.4563682,0.07748680658968943,0.62440336,0.4899733,0.07763667755475623,0.61248285,0.41171992,0.08807844463013431,0.6676517,0.36407208,0.044965990073249085,0.49429098,0.024477852508425713,0.12088718265295029

Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.

At the molecular level, LIN28 is known to repress maturation of let-7 microRNAs and enhance translation of certain mRNAs. In this study, we obtain a genome-wide view of the molecular function of LIN28A in mouse embryonic stem cells by carrying out RNA crosslinking-immunoprecipitation- sequencing (CLIP-seq) and ribosome footprinting. We find that, in addition to let-7 precursors, LIN28A binds to a large number of spliced mRNAs. LIN28A recognizes AAGNNG, AAGNG, and less frequently UGUG, which are located in the terminal loop of a small hairpin. LIN28A is localized to the periendoplasmic reticulum (ER) area and inhibits translation of mRNAs that are destined for the ER, reducing the synthesis of transmembrane proteins, ER or Golgi lumen proteins, and secretory proteins. Our study suggests a selective regulatory mechanism for ER-associated translation and reveals an unexpected role of LIN28A as a global suppressor of genes in the secretory pathway. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Cho J.; Chang H.; Kwon S.C.; Kim B.; Kim Y.; Choe J.; Ha M.; Kim Y.K.; Kim V.N.,59.0,717963721.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2012,7,0.8523387,0.5836932,0.5666705,0.81586766,0.46435463,0.07907618276451106,0.5757779,0.5089093,0.09912701572106736,0.59112847,0.4241674,0.07965691043183143,0.66253763,0.43543506,0.07398265837819884,0.42064497,0.5727588534355164,0.004816107917577028

However, why proliferating cells adopt this less efficient metabolism, especially in an oxygen-replete environment, remains incompletely understood. We show here that aerobic glycolysis is specifically required for effector function in T cells but that this pathway is not necessary for proliferation or survival. When activated T cells are provided with costimulation and growth factors but are blocked from engaging glycolysis, their ability to produce IFN-γ is markedly compromised. This defect is translational and is regulated by the binding of the glycolysis enzyme GAPDH to AU-rich elements within the 3′ UTR of IFN-γ mRNA. GAPDH, by engaging/disengaging glycolysis and through fluctuations in its expression, controls effector cytokine production. Thus, aerobic glycolysis is a metabolically regulated signaling mechanism needed to control cellular function.

Here, we resolved the in situ architecture of septal junctions by electron cryotomography of cryo-focused ion beam-milled cyanobacterial filaments. Septal junctions consisted of a tube traversing the septal peptidoglycan. Each tube end comprised a FraD-containing plug, which was covered by a cytoplasmic cap. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that intercellular communication was blocked upon stress. Gating was accompanied by a reversible conformational change of the septal junction cap. We provide the mechanistic framework for a cell junction that predates eukaryotic gap junctions by a billion years.

RSA is shaped by multiple developmental processes that are largely governed by the phytohormone auxin, suggesting that auxin regulates responses of roots that are important for local adaptation. However, auxin has a central role in numerous processes, and it is unclear which molecular mechanisms contribute to the variation in RSA for environmental adaptation. Using natural variation in Arabidopsis, we identify EXOCYST70A3 as a modulator of the auxin system that causes variation in RSA by acting on PIN4 protein distribution. Allelic variation and genetic perturbation of EXOCYST70A3 lead to alteration of root gravitropic responses, resulting in a different RSA depth profile and drought resistance. Overall our findings suggest that the local modulation of the pleiotropic auxin pathway can gives rise to distinct RSAs that can be adaptive in specific environments.

TMEM16F of the TMEM16 family that includes TMEM16A/B Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (CaCCs) is linked to Scott syndrome with deficient Ca2+-dependent lipid scrambling. We generated TMEM16F knockout mice that exhibit bleeding defects and protection in an arterial thrombosis model associated with platelet deficiency in Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure and procoagulant activity and lack a Ca2+-activated cation current in the platelet precursor megakaryocytes. Heterologous expression of TMEM16F generates a small-conductance Ca2+-activated nonselective cation (SCAN) current with subpicosiemens single-channel conductance rather than a CaCC. TMEM16F-SCAN channels permeate both monovalent and divalent cations, including Ca2+, and exhibit synergistic gating by Ca2+ and voltage. We further pinpointed a residue in the putative pore region important for the cation versus anion selectivity of TMEM16F-SCAN and TMEM16A-CaCC channels. This study thus identifies a Ca2+-activated channel permeable to Ca2+ and critical for Ca2+-dependent scramblase activity during blood coagulation.

Using zebrafish and human cells, we show that homozygous loss of APC causes failed intestinal cell differentiation but that this occurs in the absence of nuclear β-catenin and increased intestinal cell proliferation. Therefore, loss of APC is insufficient for causing β-catenin nuclear localization. APC mutation-induced intestinal differentiation defects instead depend on the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein-1 (CtBP1), whereas proliferation defects and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin require the additional activation of KRAS. These findings suggest that, following APC loss, CtBP1 contributes to adenoma initiation as a first step, whereas KRAS activation and β-catenin nuclear localization promote adenoma progression to carcinomas as a second step.

The evolutionary processes that allow herbivorous insects to resist plant defenses remain largely unknown. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional horizontal gene transfer event, the whitefly has acquired the plant-derived phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteflies to neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was confirmed by genetically transforming tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing the whiteflies’ detoxification ability. These findings reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop protection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.The cosmopolitan agricultural pest Bemisia tabaci has acquired a plant-derived gene through a plant-to-insect horizontal gene transfer event.

Because mutagenic translesion synthesis (TLS) contributes to chemoresistance as well as treatment-induced mutations, targeting TLS is an attractive avenue for improving chemotherapeutics. However, development of small molecules with high specificity and in vivo efficacy for mutagenic TLS has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor, JH-RE-06, that disrupts mutagenic TLS by preventing recruitment of mutagenic POL ζ. Remarkably, JH-RE-06 targets a nearly featureless surface of REV1 that interacts with the REV7 subunit of POL ζ. Binding of JH-RE-06 induces REV1 dimerization, which blocks the REV1-REV7 interaction and POL ζ recruitment. JH-RE-06 inhibits mutagenic TLS and enhances cisplatin-induced toxicity in cultured human and mouse cell lines. Co-administration of JH-RE-06 with cisplatin suppresses the growth of xenograft human melanomas in mice, establishing a framework for developing TLS inhibitors as a novel class of chemotherapy adjuvants.

Treatment with melatonin ameliorates disease in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis and directly interferes with the differentiation of human and mouse T cells.

Cleavage of ephrin-A2 by the ADAM10 membrane metalloprotease enables contact repulsion between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells. How ADAM10 interacts with ephrins in a regulated manner to cleave only Eph bound ephrin molecules remains unclear. The structure of ADAM10 disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains and the functional studies presented here define an essential substrate-recognition module for functional interaction of ADAM10 with the ephrin-A5/EphA3 complex. While ADAM10 constitutively associates with EphA3, the formation of a functional EphA3/ephrin-A5 complex creates a new molecular recognition motif for the ADAM10 cysteine-rich domain that positions the proteinase domain for effective ephrin-A5 cleavage. Surprisingly, the cleavage occurs in trans, with ADAM10 and its substrate being on the membranes of opposing cells.

Here, we describe a general approach for identifying specific cell types in which a disease allele exerts a pathogenic effect. Applying this approach to MS risk loci, we pinpoint likely pathogenic cell types for 70%. In addition to T cell loci, we unexpectedly identified myeloid- and CNS-specific risk loci, including two sites that dysregulate transcriptional pause release in oligodendrocytes. Functional studies demonstrated inhibition of transcriptional elongation is a dominant pathway blocking oligodendrocyte maturation. Furthermore, pause release factors are frequently dysregulated in MS brain tissue.

Unlike exclusively octameric canonical H3 nucleosomes, CENP-A nucleosomes have been shown to exist as octamers, hexamers, and tetramers. An intriguing possibility reconciling these observations is that CENP-A nucleosomes cycle between octamers and tetramers in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by tracking CENP-A nucleosomal components, structure, chromatin folding, and covalent modifications across the human cell cycle. We report that CENP-A nucleosomes alter from tetramers to octamers before replication and revert to tetramers after replication. These structural transitions are accompanied by reversible chaperone binding, chromatin fiber folding changes, and previously undescribed modifications within the histone fold domains of CENP-A and H4. Our results reveal a cyclical nature to CENP-A nucleosome structure and have implications for the maintenance of epigenetic memory after centromere replication. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Bui M.; Dimitriadis E.K.; Hoischen C.; An E.; Quenet D.; Giebe S.; Nita-Lazar A.; Diekmann S.; Dalal Y.,55.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2012,7,0.7740982,0.5616438,0.55314016,0.78691643,0.473585,0.08281088554477045,0.6839465,0.4427551,0.07018028948712163,0.4315397,0.4151144,0.071426089944026,0.662089,0.3611138,0.039686437687938,0.46696565,0.6091988682746887,-0.2717725336551666

How psychedelics mediate their actions—both therapeutic and hallucinogenic—are not understood, although activation of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH—a prototypical hallucinogen—in complex with an engineered Gαq heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-Gαq protein interactions as well as the conformational rearrangements involved in active-state transitions.

Reversible carboxyl methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit is an essential regulatory mechanism for its function. Demethylation and negative regulation of PP2A is mediated by a PP2A-specific methylesterase PME-1, which is conserved from yeast to humans. However, the underlying mechanism of PME-1 function remains enigmatic. Here we report the crystal structures of PME-1 by itself and in complex with a PP2A heterodimeric core enzyme. The structures reveal that PME-1 directly binds to the active site of PP2A and that this interaction results in the activation of PME-1 by rearranging the catalytic triad into an active conformation. Strikingly, these interactions also lead to inactivation of PP2A by evicting the manganese ions that are required for the phosphatase activity of PP2A.

The biological outcome of TNFα treatment is determined by the balance between NF-κB and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling; NF-κB promotes survival, whereas JNK enhances cell death. Critically, identity of a JNK substrate that promotes TNFα-induced apoptosis has been outstanding. Here we show that TNFα-mediated JNK activation accelerates turnover of the NF-κB-induced antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8. This is not due to direct c-FLIP phosphorylation but depends on JNK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which specifically ubiquitinates c-FLIP and induces its proteasomal degradation.

Delivery of pattern recognition receptor agonists is one strategy to improve immune function; however, targeting these agonists to immune cells is challenging, and off-target signaling in cancer cells can be detrimental. Here, we engineer CAR-T cells to deliver RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA that activates RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. RN7SL1 promotes expansion and effector-memory differentiation of CAR-T cells. Moreover, RN7SL1 is deployed in extracellular vesicles and selectively transferred to immune cells. Unlike other RNA agonists, transferred RN7SL1 restricts myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) development, decreases TGFB in myeloid cells, and fosters dendritic cell (DC) subsets with costimulatory features. Consequently, endogenous effector-memory and tumor-specific T cells also expand, allowing rejection of solid tumors with CAR antigen loss.

Higher resilience is typically ascribed to “dormant” non-growing cellular states. Here, by measuring membrane potential dynamics of Bacillus subtilis cells, we show that actively growing bacteria can cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics through an alternative mechanism based on ion flux modulation. Specifically, we observed two types of cellular behavior: growth-defective cells exhibited a mathematically predicted transient increase in membrane potential (hyperpolarization), followed by cell death, whereas growing cells lacked hyperpolarization events and showed elevated survival. Using structural perturbations of the ribosome and proteomic analysis, we uncovered that stress resilience arises from magnesium influx, which prevents hyperpolarization. Thus, ion flux modulation provides a distinct mechanism to cope with ribosomal stress. These results suggest new approaches to increase the effectiveness of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and reveal an intriguing connection between ribosomes and the membrane potential, two fundamental properties of cells.

To identify human-specific features of cortical development, we leveraged recent innovations that permit generating pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types and developmental processes. We further identified 261 differentially expressed genes in human compared to both chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene duplications, and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. We observed increased activation of this pathway in human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8.

PCP in vertebrates regulates stereocilia alignment in neurosensory cells of the cochlea and closure of the neural tube through convergence and extension movements (CE). Noncanonical Wnt morphogens regulate PCP and CE in vertebrates, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Smurfs are ubiquitin ligases that regulate signaling, cell polarity and motility through spatiotemporally restricted ubiquitination of diverse substrates. Here, we report an unexpected role for Smurfs in controlling PCP and CE. Mice mutant for Smurf1 and Smurf2 display PCP defects in the cochlea and CE defects that include a failure to close the neural tube. Further, we show that Smurfs engage in a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that targets the core PCP protein Prickle1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

Dicer recognizes the 2 nt 3′ overhang structure to selectively process pre-miRNAs. Here, we find that, unlike prototypic pre-miRNAs (group I), group II pre-miRNAs acquire a shorter (1 nt) 3′ overhang from Drosha processing and therefore require a 3′-end mono-uridylation for Dicer processing. The majority of let-7 and miR-105 belong to group II. We identify TUT7/ZCCHC6, TUT4/ZCCHC11, and TUT2/PAPD4/GLD2 as the terminal uridylyl transferases responsible for pre-miRNA mono-uridylation. The TUTs act specifically on dsRNAs with a 1 nt 3′ overhang, thereby creating a 2 nt 3′ overhang. Depletion of TUTs reduces let-7 levels and disrupts let-7 function. Although the let-7 suppressor, Lin28, induces inhibitory oligo-uridylation in embryonic stem cells, mono-uridylation occurs in somatic cells lacking Lin28 to promote let-7 biogenesis.

Sublethal infection of mice with an H1N1 influenza virus related to that of the 1918 pandemic triggers massive airway damage followed by apparent regeneration. We show here that p63-expressing stem cells in the bronchiolar epithelium undergo rapid proliferation after infection and radiate to interbronchiolar regions of alveolar ablation. Once there, these cells assemble into discrete, Krt5+ pods and initiate expression of markers typical of alveoli. Gene expression profiles of these pods suggest that they are intermediates in the reconstitution of the alveolar-capillary network eradicated by viral infection.

Ablating these neurons or inactivating their GABAB receptors impairs fear extinction in mice, whereas activating the neurons or their axonal GABAB receptors reduces conditioned fear. Although considered exclusively inhibitory, here, GABAB mediates excitation by amplifying presynaptic Ca2+ entry through Cav2.3 channels and potentiating co-release of glutamate, acetylcholine, and neurokinin B to excite interpeduncular neurons. Activating the receptors for these neurotransmitters or enhancing neurotransmission with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor reduces fear responses of both wild-type and GABAB mutant mice.

Integration of experiments and mathematical modeling indicates that extracellular potassium emitted from the biofilm alters the membrane potential of distant cells, thereby directing their motility. This electrically mediated attraction appears to be a generic mechanism that enables cross-species interactions, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells also become attracted to the electrical signal released by the B. subtilis biofilm.

Despite these versatile tasks in mammalian biology, their skills on a cellular level are deemed limited, mainly consisting in rolling, adhesion, and aggregate formation. Here, we identify an unappreciated asset of platelets and show that adherent platelets use adhesion receptors to mechanically probe the adhesive substrate in their local microenvironment. When actomyosin-dependent traction forces overcome substrate resistance, platelets migrate and pile up the adhesive substrate together with any bound particulate material. They use this ability to act as cellular scavengers, scanning the vascular surface for potential invaders and collecting deposited bacteria. Microbe collection by migrating platelets boosts the activity of professional phagocytes, exacerbating inflammatory tissue injury in sepsis. This assigns platelets a central role in innate immune responses and identifies them as potential targets to dampen inflammatory tissue damage in clinical scenarios of severe systemic infection. In addition to their role in thrombosis and hemostasis, platelets can also migrate to sites of infection to help trap bacteria and clear the vascular surface.",cell migration; host-defense; innate immunity; mechanosensing; methicillin-resistant S. aureus; NETosis; neutrophils; platelets; polarization; sepsis,Gaertner F.; Ahmad Z.; Rosenberger G.; Fan S.; Nicolai L.; Busch B.; Yavuz G.; Luckner M.; Ishikawa-Ankerhold H.; Hennel R.; Benechet A.; Lorenz M.; Chandraratne S.; Schubert I.; Helmer S.; Striednig B.; Stark K.; Janko M.; Bottcher R.T.; Verschoor A.; Leon C.; Gachet C.; Gudermann T.; Mederos y Schnitzler M.; Pincus Z.; Iannacone M.; Haas R.; Wanner G.; Lauber K.; Sixt M.; Massberg S.,69.0,732206283.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2017,8,0.93995297,0.5546407,0.5529316,0.87532085,0.39467466,0.047311412284681775,0.5428063,0.46058285,0.05691988581102625,0.666636,0.30275655,0.09063412476458188,0.27213767,0.2847594,0.03476346459750157,0.60691345,-0.07704012840986252,-0.11697583645582199

This is associated with a shift from expression of long mRNAs to shorter isoforms, incorporating alternative last exons (ALEs) that are more proximal to the transcription start site. Notably, this includes a shift from a protein-coding ASCC3 mRNA to a shorter ALE isoform of which the RNA, rather than an encoded protein, is critical for the eventual recovery of transcription. The non-coding ASCC3 isoform counteracts the function of the protein-coding isoform, indicating crosstalk between them.

Here we show that molecular gradients can also instruct the formation of a discrete neural map. In the fly olfactory system, axons of 50 classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and dendrites of 50 classes of projection neurons (PNs) form one-to-one connections at discrete units called glomeruli. We provide expression, loss- and gain-of-function data to demonstrate that the levels of transmembrane Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a), acting cell-autonomously as a receptor or part of a receptor complex, direct the dendritic targeting of PNs along the dorsolateral to ventromedial axis of the antennal lobe. Sema-1a also regulates PN axon targeting in higher olfactory centers. Thus, graded expression of Sema-1a contributes to connection specificity from ORNs to PNs and then to higher brain centers, ensuring proper representation of olfactory information in the brain. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Targeted in vivo recordings revealed them to be Aβ field-LTMRs, identified 50 years ago but largely elusive thereafter. Remarkably, while Aβ field-LTMRs are highly sensitive to gentle stroking of the skin, they are unresponsive to hair deflection, and they encode skin indentation in the noxious range across large, spotty receptive fields. Individual Aβ field-LTMRs form up to 180 circumferential endings, making them the most anatomically expansive LTMR identified to date.

To find host cell modifiers of influenza A H1N1 viral infection, we used a functional genomic screen and identified over 120 influenza A virus-dependency factors with roles in endosomal acidification, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial metabolism, and RNA splicing. We discovered that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1, 2, and 3 restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication. The IFITM proteins confer basal resistance to influenza A virus but are also inducible by interferons type I and II and are critical for interferon's virustatic actions.

This sense informs subsequent behavior, such as investing more—whether time, effort, or money—when reward is more certain. A neural representation of confidence should originate from a statistical computation and predict confidence-guided behavior. An additional requirement for confidence representations to support metacognition is abstraction: they should emerge irrespective of the source of information and inform multiple confidence-guided behaviors. It is unknown whether neural confidence signals meet these criteria. Here, we show that single orbitofrontal cortex neurons in rats encode statistical decision confidence irrespective of the sensory modality, olfactory or auditory, used to make a choice. The activity of these neurons also predicts two confidence-guided behaviors: trial-by-trial time investment and cross-trial choice strategy updating. Orbitofrontal cortex thus represents decision confidence consistent with a metacognitive process that is useful for mediating confidence-guided economic decisions.

Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of μ-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, improving patients’ quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal burden due to variable drug responsiveness.

TBL1/TBLR1 serve as specific adaptors for the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugating/19S proteasome complex, with TBLR1 selectively serving to mediate a required exchange of the nuclear receptor corepressors, N-CoR and SMRT, for coactivators upon ligand binding. Tbl1 gene deletion in embryonic stem cells severely impairs PPARγ-induced adipogenic differentiation, indicating that TBL1 function is also biologically indispensable for specific nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation events.

The structure of the E. coli clamp loader bound to DNA reveals the formation of an ATP-dependent spiral of ATPase domains that tracks only the template strand, allowing recognition of both RNA and DNA primers. Unlike hexameric helicases, in which DNA translocation requires distinct conformations of the ATPase domains, the clamp loader spiral is symmetric and is set up to trigger release upon DNA recognition. Specificity for primed DNA arises from blockage of the end of the primer and accommodation of the emerging template along a surface groove. A related structure reveals how the ψ protein, essential for coupling the clamp loader to single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), binds to the clamp loader. By stabilizing a conformation of the clamp loader that is consistent with the ATPase spiral observed upon DNA binding, ψ binding promotes the clamp-loading activity of the complex. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To test this, we exposed diverse bacterial species to sublethal concentrations of a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor and observed dose-dependent decreases in SA/V.

The densest, in human lymphoblastoid cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs ""facing"" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats.

To understand how neuronal circuits control variability, we examined the propagation of sensory information in a chemotaxis circuit of C. Elegans where discrete sensory inputs can drive a probabilistic behavioral response. Olfactory neurons respond to odor stimuli with rapid and reliable changes in activity, but downstream AIB interneurons respond with a probabilistic delay. The interneuron response to odor depends on the collective activity of multiple neurons - AIB, RIM, and AVA - when the odor stimulus arrives. Certain activity states of the network correlate with reliable responses to odor stimuli. Artificially generating these activity states by modifying neuronal activity increases the reliability of odor responses in interneurons and the reliability of the behavioral response to odor.

Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5′ end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The acceleration of ETI mother cell aging was not explained by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), Sir protein perturbation, or deprotected telomeres. ETI phenotypes occurred well before the population senescence caused late after telomerase inactivation (LTI).

Mal3p particles usually formed a single line on each microtubule along just one of the multiple grooves that are formed by adjacent protofilaments. We provide structural data showing that the alignment of Mal3p molecules coincides with the microtubule lattice seam as well as data suggesting that Mal3p not only binds but also stabilizes this seam. Accordingly, Mal3p stabilizes microtubules through a specific interaction with what is potentially the weakest part of the microtubule in a way not previously demonstrated.

Along with novel insights into the biology of individual sarcoma types, we report three overarching findings: (1) unlike most epithelial malignancies, these sarcomas (excepting synovial sarcoma) are characterized predominantly by copy-number changes, with low mutational loads and only a few genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1) highly recurrently mutated across sarcoma types; (2) within sarcoma types, genomic and regulomic diversity of driver pathways defines molecular subtypes associated with patient outcome; and (3) the immune microenvironment, inferred from DNA methylation and mRNA profiles, associates with outcome and may inform clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, this large-scale analysis reveals previously unappreciated sarcoma-type-specific changes in copy number, methylation, RNA, and protein, providing insights into refining sarcoma therapy and relationships to other cancer types. Genetic analysis of soft tissue sarcomas shows that they are characterized predominantly by copy-number changes and offers insights into the immune microenviroment to inform clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors.",dedifferentiated liposarcoma; DNA methylation; genomics; immune infiltration; leiomyosarcoma; molecular subtype; myxofibrosarcoma; pleomorphism; The Cancer Genome Atlas; undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,Abeshouse A.; Adebamowo C.; Adebamowo S.N.; Akbani R.; Akeredolu T.; Ally A.; Anderson M.L.; Anur P.; Appelbaum E.L.; Armenia J.; Auman J.T.; Bailey M.H.; Baker L.; Balasundaram M.; Balu S.; Barthel F.P.; Bartlett J.; Baylin S.B.; Behera M.; Belyaev D.; Bennett J.; Benz C.; Beroukhim R.; Birrer M.; Bocklage T.; Bodenheimer T.; Boice L.; Bootwalla M.S.; Bowen J.; Bowlby R.; Boyd J.; Brohl A.S.; Brooks D.; Byers L.; Carlsen R.; Castro P.; Chen H.-W.; Cherniack A.D.; Chibon F.; Chin L.; Cho J.; Chuah E.; Chudamani S.; Cibulskis C.; Cooper L.A.D.; Cope L.; Cordes M.G.; Crain D.; Curley E.; Danilova L.; Dao F.; Davis I.J.; Davis L.E.; Defreitas T.; Delman K.; Demchok J.A.; Demetri G.D.; Demicco E.G.; Dhalla N.; Diao L.; Ding L.; DiSaia P.; Dottino P.; Doyle L.A.; Drill E.; Dubina M.; Eschbacher J.; Fedosenko K.; Felau I.; Ferguson M.L.; Frazer S.; Fronick C.C.; Fulidou V.; Fulton L.A.; Fulton R.S.; Gabriel S.B.; Gao J.; Gao Q.; Gardner J.; Gastier-Foster J.M.; Gay C.M.; Gehlenborg N.; Gerken M.; Getz G.; Godwin A.K.; Godwin E.M.; Gordienko E.; Grilley-Olson J.E.; Gutman D.A.; Gutmann D.H.; Hayes D.N.; Hegde A.M.; Heiman D.I.; Heins Z.; Helsel C.; Hepperla A.J.; Higgins K.; Hoadley K.A.; Hobensack S.; Holt R.A.; Hoon D.B.; Hornick J.L.; Hoyle A.P.; Hu X.; Huang M.; Hutter C.M.; Iacocca M.; Ingram D.R.; Ittmann M.; Iype L.; Jefferys S.R.; Jones K.B.; Jones C.D.; Jones S.J.M.; Kalir T.; Karlan B.Y.; Karseladze A.; Kasaian K.; Kim J.; Kundra R.; Kuo H.; Ladanyi M.; Lai P.H.; Laird P.W.; Larsson E.; Lawrence M.S.; Lazar A.J.; Lee S.; Lee D.; Lehmann K.-V.; Leraas K.M.; Lester J.; Levine D.A.; Li I.; Lichtenberg T.M.; Lin P.; Liu J.; Liu W.; Liu E.M.; Lolla L.; Lu Y.; Ma Y.; Madan R.; Maglinte D.T.; Magliocco A.; Maki R.G.; Mallery D.; Manikhas G.; Mardis E.R.; Mariamidze A.; Marra M.A.; Martignetti J.A.; Martinez C.; Mayo M.; McLellan M.D.; Meier S.; Meng S.; Meyerson M.; Mieczkowski P.A.; Miller C.A.; Mills G.B.; Moore R.A.; Morris S.; Mose L.E.; Mozgovoy E.; Mungall A.J.; Mungall K.; Nalisnik M.; Naresh R.; Newton Y.; Noble M.S.; Novak J.E.; Ochoa A.; Olvera N.; Owonikoko T.K.; Paklina O.; Parfitt J.; Parker J.S.; Pastore A.; Paulauskis J.; Penny R.; Pereira E.; Perou C.M.; Perou A.H.; Pihl T.; Pollock R.E.; Potapova O.; Radenbaugh A.J.; Ramalingam S.S.; Ramirez N.C.; Rathmell W.K.; Raut C.P.; Riedel R.F.; Reilly C.; Reynolds S.M.; Roach J.; Robertson A.G.; Roszik J.; Rubin B.P.; Sadeghi S.; Saksena G.; Salner A.; Sanchez-Vega F.; Sander C.; Schein J.E.; Schmidt H.K.; Schultz N.; Schumacher S.E.; Sekhon H.; Senbabaoglu Y.; Setdikova G.; Shelton C.; Shelton T.; Shen R.; Shi Y.; Shih J.; Shmulevich I.; Sica G.L.; Simons J.V.; Singer S.; Sipahimalani P.; Skelly T.; Socci N.; Sofia H.J.; Soloway M.G.; Spellman P.; Sun Q.; Swanson P.; Tam A.; Tan D.; Tarnuzzer R.; Thiessen N.; Thompson E.; Thorne L.B.; Tong P.; Torres K.E.; van de Rijn M.; Van Den Berg D.J.; Van Tine B.A.; Veluvolu U.; Verhaak R.; Voet D.; Voronina O.; Wan Y.; Wang Z.; Wang J.; Weinstein J.N.; Weisenberger D.J.; Wilkerson M.D.; Wilson R.K.; Wise L.; Wong T.; Wong W.; Wrangle J.; Wu Y.; Wyczalkowski M.; Yang L.; Yau C.; Yellapantula V.; Zenklusen J.C.; Zhang J.J.; Zhang H.; Zhang H.; Zmuda E.,85.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2017,8,0.9211573,0.48389432,0.48577127,0.86074996,0.4424131,0.010155031395049807,0.27170247,0.48489285,0.07627110888159322,0.46738732,0.3981824,0.08251683070076071,0.44066194,0.46407497,0.1085534882822144,0.3151211,0.1177881583571434,-0.08161316812038422

In cells, histone chaperone Asf1 is essential for H3K56 acetylation, yet the mechanisms for H3K56 specificity and Asf1 requirement remain unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rtt109-Asf1-H3-H4 complex and found that unwinding of histone H3 αN, where K56 is normally located, and stabilization of the very C-terminal β strand of histone H4 by Asf1 are prerequisites for H3K56 acetylation. Unexpectedly, an interaction between Rtt109 and the central helix of histone H3 is also required. The observed multiprotein, multisite substrate recognition mechanism among histone modification enzymes provides mechanistic understandings of Rtt109 and Asf1 in H3K56 acetylation, as well as valuable insights into substrate recognition by histone modification enzymes in general.

The localization of several competence proteins, required for DNA uptake, has been studied using fluorescence microscopy. At least three proteins (ComGA, ComFA, and YwpH) are preferentially associated with the cell poles and appear to colocalize. This association is dynamic; the proteins accumulate at the poles as transformability develops and then delocalize as transformability wanes. DNA binding and uptake also occur preferentially at the cell poles, as shown using fluorescent DNA and in single-molecule experiments with laser tweezers. In addition to the prominent polar sites, the competence proteins also localize as foci in association with the lateral cell membrane, but this distribution does not exhibit the same temporal changes as the polar accumulation.

To learn how C. elegans Dicer, DCR-1, functions in multiple distinct silencing mechanisms, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify DCR-1-interacting proteins. We then generated and characterized deletion alleles for the corresponding genes. The interactors are required for production of three species of small RNA, including (1) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), derived from exogenous dsRNA triggers (exo-siRNAs); (2) siRNAs derived from endogenous triggers (endo-siRNAs); and (3) developmental regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). One interactor, the conserved RNA-phosphatase homolog PIR-1, is required for the processing of a putative amplified DCR-1 substrate. Interactors required for endo-siRNA production include ERI-1 and RRF-3, whose loss of function enhances RNAi.

In contrast to STIM1, a recently discovered signal transducer that triggers Ca2+ influx in response to receptor-mediated depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, STIM2 activated Ca2+ influx upon smaller decreases in ER Ca2+. STIM2, like STIM1, caused Ca2+ influx via activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel Orai1. Our study places STIM2 at the center of a feedback module that keeps basal cytosolic and ER Ca2+ concentrations within tight limits. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous developmental disorders and pathological conditions have been shown to arise from defects in cilia-associated signaling proteins. Despite mounting evidence that cilia are essential sites for coordination of cell signaling, little is known about the cellular mechanisms controlling their formation and disassembly. Here, we show that interactions between the prometastatic scaffolding protein HEF1/Cas-L/NEDD9 and the oncogenic Aurora A (AurA) kinase at the basal body of cilia causes phosphorylation and activation of HDAC6, a tubulin deacetylase, promoting ciliary disassembly. We show that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for ciliary resorption and that it constitutes an unexpected nonmitotic activity of AurA in vertebrates. Moreover, we demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors of AurA and HDAC6 selectively stabilize cilia from regulated resorption cues, suggesting a novel mode of action for these clinical agents. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Some familial PrP mutants generate increased CtmPrP, a transmembrane isoform associated with disease. In other disease situations, a potentially toxic cytosolic form (termed cyPrP) might be produced. However, the mechanisms by which CtmPrP or cyPrP cause selective neuronal dysfunction are unknown. Here, we show that both CtmPrP and cyPrP can interact with and disrupt the function of Mahogunin (Mgrn), a cytosolic ubiquitin ligase whose loss causes spongiform neurodegeneration. Cultured cells and transgenic mice expressing either CtmPrP-producing mutants or cyPrP partially phenocopy Mgrn depletion, displaying aberrant lysosomal morphology and loss of Mgrn in selected brain regions. These effects were rescued by either Mgrn overexpression, competition for PrP-binding sites, or prevention of cytosolic PrP exposure. Thus, transient or partial exposure of PrP to the cytosol leads to inappropriate Mgrn sequestration that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and disease. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we have found a role for the influenza virus M2 proton-selective ion channel protein in mediating virus budding. We observed that a highly conserved amphipathic helix located within the M2 cytoplasmic tail mediates a cholesterol-dependent alteration in membrane curvature. The 17 amino acid amphipathic helix is sufficient for budding into giant unilamellar vesicles, and mutation of this sequence inhibited budding of transfected M2 protein in vivo. We show that M2 localizes to the neck of budding virions and that mutation of the M2 amphipathic helix results in failure of the virus to undergo membrane scission and virion release.

Here, we show that an essential PRC component, Ezh2, is expressed in epidermal progenitors but diminishes concomitant with embryonic differentiation and with postnatal decline in proliferative activity. We show that Ezh2 controls proliferative potential of basal progenitors by repressing the Ink4A-Ink4B locus and tempers the developmental rate of differentiation by preventing premature recruitment of AP1 transcriptional activator to the structural genes that are required for epidermal differentiation. Together, our studies reveal that PRCs control epigenetic modifications temporally and spatially in tissue-restricted stem cells.

Synapses are thought to present large ATP demands; however, it is unclear how fuel availability and electrical activity impact synaptic ATP levels and how ATP availability controls synaptic function. We developed a quantitative genetically encoded optical reporter of presynaptic ATP, Syn-ATP, and find that electrical activity imposes large metabolic demands that are met via activity-driven control of both glycolysis and mitochondrial function. We discovered that the primary source of activity-driven metabolic demand is the synaptic vesicle cycle. In metabolically intact synapses, activity-driven ATP synthesis is well matched to the energetic needs of synaptic function, which, at steady state, results in ∼106 free ATPs per nerve terminal.

We report the high-resolution NMR structure of the cargo-free myosin VI cargo-binding domain (CBD) and show that it is a stable monomer in solution. The myosin VI CBD binds to a fragment of the clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor Dab2 with a high affinity, and the X-ray structure of the myosin VI CBD in complex with Dab2 reveals that the motor undergoes a cargo-binding-mediated dimerization.

K1268 ubiquitylation affects DNA repair and signals RNAPII degradation, essential for surviving genotoxic insult. RNAPII degradation results in a shutdown of transcriptional initiation, in the absence of which cells display dramatic transcriptome alterations. Additionally, regulation of RNAPII stability is central to transcription recovery—persistent RNAPII depletion underlies the failure of this process in Cockayne syndrome B cells.

Resting lymphocytes also limit the expression of the transcription factor IIH complex, including XPB and XPD helicases involved in promoter melting and open complex extension. To date, two rate-limiting steps have been shown to control global gene expression in eukaryotes: preinitiation complex assembly and polymerase pausing. Our studies identify promoter melting as a third key regulatory step and propose that this mechanism ensures a prompt lymphocyte response to invading pathogens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Kouzine F.; Wojtowicz D.; Yamane A.; Resch W.; Kieffer-Kwon K.-R.; Bandle R.; Nelson S.; Nakahashi H.; Awasthi P.; Feigenbaum L.; Menoni H.; Hoeijmakers J.; Vermeulen W.; Ge H.; Przytycka T.M.; Levens D.; Casellas R.,82.0,718023260.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,0.67532957,0.5149912,0.5307584,0.5603151,0.5032547,0.07763770883286464,0.5095685,0.50284994,0.09518685762872636,0.6354216,0.444602,0.08786471738079621,0.5979429,0.5109313,0.12294689197776454,0.49475217,-0.37738296389579773,0.19379085302352905

Despite their complexity, bacterial pathogens have evolved parsimonious mechanisms to hijack these systems. Here, we develop a tractable experimental and theoretical model to uncover fundamental operating principles, in both mammalian cell polarity and bacterial pathogenesis. Using synthetic derivatives of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Map, we discover that Cdc42 GTPase signal transduction is controlled by the interaction between Map and F-actin. Mathematical modeling reveals how actin dynamics coupled to a Map-dependent positive feedback loop spontaneously polarizes Cdc42 on the plasma membrane. By rewiring the pathogenic signaling circuit to operate through β-integrin stimulation, we further show how Cdc42 is polarized in response to an extracellular spatial cue. Thus, a molecular pathway of polarity is proposed, centered on the interaction between GEFs and F-actin, which is likely to function in diverse biological systems. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,Orchard R.C.; Kittisopikul M.; Altschuler S.J.; Wu L.F.; Suel G.M.; Alto N.M.,57.0,714747805.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2012,7,0.61563456,0.60705405,0.49041572,0.6186563,0.47574055,0.07732673324171147,0.5350127,0.489354,0.08309525515086447,0.5903796,0.36323285,0.08248052142303464,0.509146,0.43052828,0.07614749819728983,0.6697164,0.7136191725730896,0.3584684133529663

Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis involving isolated cell subpopulations from infected lungs showed that neutrophil influx largely accounted for the predictive transcriptional signature. Automated imaging analysis, together with these gene expression and flow data, identified a chemokine-driven feedforward circuit involving proinflammatory neutrophils potently driven by poorly contained lethal viruses.

First, transposon end binding causes a conformational change that aligns catalytically important protein residues within the active site. Subsequent precise cleavage at the left and right ends, the steps that liberate the transposon from its donor site, does not involve a site-specific DNA-binding domain. Rather, cleavage site recognition occurs by complementary base pairing with a TnpA-bound subterminal transposon DNA segment. Thus, the enzyme active site is constructed from elements of both protein and DNA, reminiscent of the interdependence of protein and RNA in the ribosome.

We found neural populations in bilateral dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (dLMC) that selectively encoded produced pitch but not non-laryngeal articulatory movements.

They are thought to be composed exclusively of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) that replicates in the body by inducing the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Although compelling evidence supports this hypothesis, generation of infectious prion particles in vitro has not been convincingly demonstrated. Here we show that PrPC → PrPres conversion can be mimicked in vitro by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding, resulting in indefinite amplification of PrPres. The in vitro-generated forms of PrPres share similar biochemical and structural properties with PrPres derived from sick brains. Inoculation of wild-type hamsters with in vitro-produced PrPres led to a scrapie disease identical to the illness produced by brain infectious material. These findings demonstrate that prions can be generated in vitro and provide strong evidence in support of the protein-only hypothesis of prion transmission.

Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation.

These RNAs are evolutionarily conserved in mammalian genomes and thus presumably function in diverse biological processes. Here, we report the identification of lincRNAs that are regulated by p53. One of these lincRNAs (lincRNA-p21) serves as a repressor in p53-dependent transcriptional responses. Inhibition of lincRNA-p21 affects the expression of hundreds of gene targets enriched for genes normally repressed by p53. The observed transcriptional repression by lincRNA-p21 is mediated through the physical association with hnRNP-K. This interaction is required for proper genomic localization of hnRNP-K at repressed genes and regulation of p53 mediates apoptosis. We propose a model whereby transcription factors activate lincRNAs that serve as key repressors by physically associating with repressive complexes and modulate their localization to sets of previously active genes.

Distinct SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool.

We describe here an approach to pharmacologically interrogate the PI3-K family. A chemically diverse panel of PI3-K inhibitors was synthesized, and their target selectivity was biochemically enumerated, revealing cryptic homologies across targets and chemotypes. Crystal structures of three inhibitors bound to p110γ identify a conformationally mobile region that is uniquely exploited by selective compounds. This chemical array was then used to define the PI3-K isoforms required for insulin signaling. We find that p110α is the primary insulin-responsive PI3-K in cultured cells, whereas p110β is dispensable but sets a phenotypic threshold for p110α activity. Compounds targeting p110α block the acute effects of insulin treatment in vivo, whereas a p110β inhibitor has no effect.

Acute attacks are treated by heme infusion and glucose administration, but the mechanisms underlying the precipitating effects of fasting and the beneficial effects of glucose are unknown. We show that the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-1), is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Elevation of PGC-1α in mice via adenoviral vectors increases the levels of heme precursors in vivo as observed in acute attacks. The induction of ALAS-1 by fasting is lost in liver-specific PGC-1α knockout animals, as is the ability of porphyrogenic drugs to dysregulate heme biosynthesis.

However, a major challenge in plant biology is to decipher how individual clocks are interconnected to sustain rhythms in the whole plant. Here we show that the shoot apex is composed of an ensemble of coupled clocks that influence rhythms in roots. Live-imaging of single cells, desynchronization of dispersed protoplasts, and mathematical analysis using barycentric coordinates for high-dimensional space show a gradation in the strength of circadian communication in different tissues, with shoot apex clocks displaying the highest coupling. The increased synchrony confers robustness of morning and evening oscillations and particular capabilities for phase readjustments. Rhythms in roots are altered by shoot apex ablation and micrografting, suggesting that signals from the shoot apex are able to synchronize distal organs.

The fundamental requirement for faithful centromere inheritance is the controlled deposition of the centromere-specifying histone, CENP-A. However, the regulatory mechanisms that ensure the precise control of CENP-A deposition have proven elusive. Here, we identify polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as a centromere-localized regulator required to initiate CENP-A deposition in human cells. We demonstrate that faithful CENP-A deposition requires integrated signals from Plk1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), with Plk1 promoting the localization of the key CENP-A deposition factor, the Mis18 complex, and CDK inhibiting Mis18 complex assembly. By bypassing these regulated steps, we uncoupled CENP-A deposition from cell-cycle progression, resulting in mitotic defects.

We study timing variability during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiated upon nutritional starvation.

This variability is concentrated between the beginning of starvation and the onset of early meiosis genes. Cell-cycle variability and nutritional history have little effect on this timing variability. Rather, variation in the production rate of the meiotic master regulator Ime1 and its gradual increase over time govern this variability, and cell size effects are channeled through Ime1.

Because developmentally matured B cells undergo biologically programmed strand-specific DNA mutagenesis at focal DNA/RNA hybrid structures, they make a convenient system to investigate strand-specific mutagenesis mechanisms. We demonstrate that the sense and antisense strand DNA mutagenesis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and some other regions of the B cell genome depends upon localized RNA processing protein complex formation in the nucleus. Both the physical proximity and coupled activities of RNA helicase Mtr4 (and senataxin) with the noncoding RNA processing function of RNA exosome determine the strand-specific distribution of DNA mutations.

The embryonic stem cell (ESC) expression pattern governs self-renewal and pluripotency. Here, we present an RNAi screen in mouse ESCs of 1008 loci encoding chromatin proteins. We identified 68 proteins that exhibit diverse phenotypes upon knockdown (KD), including seven subunits of the Tip60-p400 complex. Phenotypic analyses revealed that Tip60-p400 is necessary to maintain characteristic features of ESCs. We show that p400 localization to the promoters of both silent and active genes is dependent upon histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Furthermore, the Tip60-p400 KD gene expression profile is enriched for developmental regulators and significantly overlaps with that of the transcription factor Nanog. Depletion of Nanog reduces p400 binding to target promoters without affecting H3K4me3 levels. Together, these data indicate that Tip60-p400 integrates signals from Nanog and H3K4me3 to regulate gene expression in ESCs. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, mirtron hairpins are defined by the action of the splicing machinery and lariat-debranching enzyme, which yield pre-miRNA-like hairpins. The mirtron pathway merges with the canonical miRNA pathway during hairpin export by Exportin-5, and both types of hairpins are subsequently processed by Dicer-1/loqs.

Analysis of nearly 400 maps reveals a core architecture consisting of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts tend to be cell-type specific and are more sensitive to changes in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C.

In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure that emerged in the cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF5-driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2, but not for KIF17-driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF17 and KIF5B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF5 loaded with VAMP2 versus GluR2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes.

How this interdependent positive feedback loop is first triggered is a fundamental unanswered question. Here, we show that two distinct Argonaute (Ago1)-dependent pathways mediate small RNA generation. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) and Dicer act on specific noncoding RNAs to generate siRNAs by a mechanism that requires the slicer activity of Ago1 but is independent of pre-existing heterochromatin. In the absence of RDRC or Dicer, a distinct class of small RNAs, called primal small RNAs (priRNAs), associates with Ago1. priRNAs are degradation products of abundant transcripts, which bind to Ago1 and target antisense transcripts that result from bidirectional transcription of DNA repeats.

Although Par-4 is expressed in neurons, its physiological role in the nervous system is unknown. Here we identify Par-4 as a regulatory component in dopamine signaling. Par-4 directly interacts with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2DR) via the calmodulin binding motif in the third cytoplasmic loop. Calmodulin can effectively compete with Par-4 binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner, providing a route for Ca2+-mediated downregulation of D2DR efficacy. To examine the importance of the Par-4/D2DR interaction in dopamine signaling in vivo, we used a mutant mouse lacking the D2DR interaction domain of Par-4, Par-4ΔLZ. Primary neurons from Par-4ΔLZ embryos exhibit an enhanced dopamine-cAMP-CREB signaling pathway, indicating an impairment in dopamine signaling in these cells. Remarkably, Par-4ΔLZ mice display significantly increased depression-like behaviors. Collectively, these results provide evidence that Par-4 constitutes a molecular link between impaired dopamine signaling and depression.

Knockdown of DmIKKε in the proneural clusters of the wing imaginal disc, in which nonapoptotic caspase activity is required for proper sensory organ precursor (SOP) development, stabilizes endogenous DIAP1 and affects Drosophila SOP development.

We find that the lipolytic effect of leptin is mediated through the action of sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the adipose tissue. Using intravital two-photon microscopy, we observe that sympathetic nerve fibers establish neuro-adipose junctions, directly ""enveloping"" adipocytes. Local optogenetic stimulation of sympathetic inputs induces a local lipolytic response and depletion of white adipose mass. Conversely, genetic ablation of sympathetic inputs onto fat pads blocks leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and consequent lipolysis, as do knockouts of dopamine β-hydroxylase, an enzyme required for catecholamine synthesis. Thus, neuro-adipose junctions are necessary and sufficient for the induction of lipolysis in white adipose tissue and are an efferent effector of leptin action.

Vesicle formation is induced by expression of wild-type caveolins, but not caveolin mutants defective in caveola formation in mammalian systems. In addition, cryoelectron tomography shows that the induced membrane domains are equivalent in size and caveolin density to native caveolae and reveals a possible polyhedral arrangement of caveolin oligomers.

On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We characterized the metabolic mechanisms that support oogenesis and found that mitochondria in mature Drosophila oocytes enter a low-activity state of respiratory quiescence by remodeling the electron transport chain (ETC). This shift in mitochondrial function leads to extensive glycogen accumulation late in oogenesis and is required for the developmental competence of the oocyte. Decreased insulin signaling initiates ETC remodeling and mitochondrial respiratory quiescence through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).

Oct4 suppresses neural ectodermal differentiation and promotes mesendodermal differentiation; Sox2 inhibits mesendodermal differentiation and promotes neural ectodermal differentiation. Differentiation signals continuously and asymmetrically modulate Oct4 and Sox2 protein levels, altering their binding pattern in the genome, and leading to cell fate choice.

An association has been reported between PD and exposure to mitochondrial toxins, including environmental pesticides paraquat, maneb, and rotenone. Here, using a robust, patient-derived stem cell model of PD allowing comparison of A53T α-synuclein (α-syn) mutant cells and isogenic mutation-corrected controls, we identify mitochondrial toxin-induced perturbations in A53T α-syn A9 DA neurons (hNs). We report a pathway whereby basal and toxin-induced nitrosative/oxidative stress results in S-nitrosylation of transcription factor MEF2C in A53T hNs compared to corrected controls. This redox reaction inhibits the MEF2C-PGC1α transcriptional network, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death.

Brief TGFβ-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that rAC-VECs are similar to adult ECs in which vascular-specific genes are expressed and nonvascular genes are silenced. Functionally, rAC-VECs form stable vasculature in Matrigel plugs and regenerating livers.

This activation comprises an amplifying circadian loop involving SIRT1, PGC-1α, and Nampt. In aged wild-type mice, SIRT1 levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are decreased, as are those of BMAL1 and PER2, giving rise to a longer intrinsic period, a more disrupted activity pattern, and an inability to adapt to changes in the light entrainment schedule. Young mice lacking brain SIRT1 phenocopy these aging-dependent circadian changes, whereas mice that overexpress SIRT1 in the brain are protected from the effects of aging.

This enabled us to create genomic maps for the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins, including disease-relevant mutants, deletions, and isoforms. In vivo binding of MBD proteins occurs predominantly as a linear function of local methylation density, requiring functional MBD domains and methyl-CPGs. This interaction directs specificity of MBD proteins to methylated, CpG-dense, and inactive regulatory regions. In contrast, binding to unmethylated sites varies between MBD proteins and is mediated via alternative domains or protein-protein interactions. Such targeting is exemplified by NuRD-complex-mediated tethering of MBD2 to a subset of unmethylated, active regulatory regions.

Here we present two cryo-EM snapshots of the Thermobifida fusca type I-E Cascade: (1) unwinding 11 bp of dsDNA at the seed-sequence region to scout for sequence complementarity, and (2) further unwinding of the entire protospacer to form a full R-loop. These structures provide the much-needed temporal and spatial resolution to resolve key mechanistic steps leading to Cas3 recruitment. In the early steps, PAM recognition causes severe DNA bending, leading to spontaneous DNA unwinding to form a seed-bubble. The full R-loop formation triggers conformational changes in Cascade, licensing Cas3 to bind. The same process also generates a bulge in the non-target DNA strand, enabling its handover to Cas3 for cleavage.

We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes. Integration of NET-seq with genomic footprinting data reveals stereotypic Pol II pausing coincident with transcription factor occupancy. Finally, exons retained in mature transcripts display Pol II pausing signatures that differ markedly from skipped exons, indicating an intrinsic capacity for Pol II to recognize exons with different processing fates.

Here, we report the discovery of significant enrichment of putative PTEN ceRNAs among genes whose loss accelerates tumorigenesis following Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of melanoma. We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels.

We show here that hematopoietic zinc finger (Hzf), a zinc-finger-containing p53 target gene, modulates p53 transactivation functions in an autoregulatory feedback loop. Hzf is induced by p53 and binds to its DNA-binding domain, resulting in preferential transactivation of proarrest p53 target genes over its proapoptotic target genes. Thus, p53 activation results in cell-cycle arrest in Hzf wild-type MEFs, while in Hzf-/- MEFs, apoptosis is induced. Exposure of Hzf null mice to ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced apoptosis in several organs, as compared to in wild-type mice. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 transactivation function and suggest that Hzf functions as a key player in regulating cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have identified a large family of potential WRC ligands, consisting of ∼120 diverse membrane proteins, including protocadherins, ROBOs, netrin receptors, neuroligins, GPCRs, and channels. Structural, biochemical, and cellular studies reveal that a sequence motif that defines these ligands binds to a highly conserved interaction surface of the WRC formed by the Sra and Abi subunits. Mutating this binding surface in flies resulted in defects in actin cytoskeletal organization and egg morphology during oogenesis, leading to female sterility.

Here, we investigate membrane fission by shallow hydrophobic insertions quantitatively and mechanistically. We provide evidence that membrane insertion of the ENTH domain of epsin leads to liposome vesiculation, and that epsin is required for clathrin-coated vesicle budding in cells. We also show that BAR-domain scaffolds from endophilin, amphiphysin, GRAF, and β2-centaurin limit membrane fission driven by hydrophobic insertions. A quantitative assay for vesiculation reveals an antagonistic relationship between amphipathic helices and scaffolds of N-BAR domains in fission.

This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation.

Significantly, GPCR-containing CCPs are also functionally distinct, as their surface residence time is regulated locally by GPCR cargo via PDZ-dependent linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Such cargo-regulated CCPs show delayed recruitment of dynamin and can undergo an abortive event in which clathrin coats separate from the plasma membrane without concomitant receptor endocytosis.

This is linked to increased epithelial apoptosis during tumor promotion. Deleting IKKβ in myeloid cells, however, results in a significant decrease in tumor size. This deletion diminishes expression of proinflammatory cytokines that may serve as tumor growth factors, without affecting apoptosis.

Therefore, two female gametes (the egg and the central cell) control independent pathways yet coordinately accomplish the elimination of the persistent synergid cell by double fertilization.",,Maruyama D.; Volz R.; Takeuchi H.; Mori T.; Igawa T.; Kurihara D.; Kawashima T.; Ueda M.; Ito M.; Umeda M.; Nishikawa S.-I.; Gross-Hardt R.; Higashiyama T.,44.0,725451282.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.41294035,0.41326424,0.38270476,0.40174976,0.44548678,0.08053861996883116,0.50342244,0.22343993,0.030712983741826017,0.5246576,0.440117,0.10349164237543845,0.4487574,0.18061411,0.0406839923975979,0.53855294,0.38405874371528625,0.037750840187072754

Whereas K48-linked chains are well established as mediators of proteasomal degradation, and K63-linked chains act in nonproteolytic events, the roles of unconventional polyubiquitin chains linked through K6, K11, K27, K29, or K33 are not well understood. Here, we report that the unconventional linkages are abundant in vivo and that all non-K63 linkages may target proteins for degradation. Ubiquitin with K48 as the single lysine cannot support yeast viability, and different linkages have partially redundant functions. By profiling both the entire yeast proteome and ubiquitinated proteins in wild-type and ubiquitin K11R mutant strains using mass spectrometry, we identified K11 linkage-specific substrates, including Ubc6, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Ubc6 primarily synthesizes K11-linked chains, and K11 linkages function in the ERAD pathway.

We investigate tissue-generating asymmetric divisions in a stem cell daughter within the Arabidopsis root. Spatial restriction of these divisions requires physical binding of the stem cell regulator SCARECROW (SCR) by the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein. In the stem cell niche, SCR activity is counteracted by phosphorylation of RBR through a cyclinD6;1-CDK complex. This cyclin is itself under transcriptional control of SCR and its partner SHORT ROOT (SHR), creating a robust bistable circuit with either high or low SHR-SCR complex activity. Auxin biases this circuit by promoting CYCD6;1 transcription. Mathematical modeling shows that ACDs are only switched on after integration of radial and longitudinal information, determined by SHR and auxin distribution, respectively.

To identify the two nuclease activities, we carried out UV-crosslinking studies using both the complete RNA substrate and the downstream cleavage product, each containing a single radioactive phosphate and a phosphorothioate modification at the cleavage site. We detected a protein migrating at 85 kDa that crosslinked to each substrate in a U7-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments identified this protein as CPSF-73, a known component of the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery.

These results support that MHC-I genotype-restricted immunoediting during tumor formation shapes the landscape of oncogenic mutations observed in clinically diagnosed tumors and paves the way for predicting personal cancer susceptibilities from knowledge of MHC-I genotype.

This wave functions in segregation by both pulling ooplasm animally and pushing yolk granules vegetally. Using biophysical experimentation and theory, we show that ooplasm pulling is mediated by bulk actin network flows exerting friction forces on the ooplasm, while yolk granule pushing is achieved by a mechanism closely resembling actin comet formation on yolk granules.

Ca2+ signaling, which halts both anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial motion, serves as one regulatory input. Anterograde mitochondrial movement is generated by kinesin-1, which interacts with the mitochondrial protein Miro through an adaptor protein, milton. We show that kinesin is present on all axonal mitochondria, including those that are stationary or moving retrograde. We also show that the EF-hand motifs of Miro mediate Ca2+-dependent arrest of mitochondria and elucidate the regulatory mechanism. Rather than dissociating kinesin-1 from mitochondria, Ca2+-binding permits Miro to interact directly with the motor domain of kinesin-1, preventing motor/microtubule interactions. Thus, kinesin-1 switches from an active state in which it is bound to Miro only via milton, to an inactive state in which direct binding to Miro prevents its interaction with microtubules.

Here, we show that, in mouse olfactory neurons, silent olfactory receptor (OR) genes from different chromosomes converge in a small number of heterochromatic foci. These foci are OR exclusive and form in a cell-type-specific and differentiation-dependent manner. The aggregation of OR genes is developmentally synchronous with the downregulation of lamin b receptor (LBR) and can be reversed by ectopic expression of LBR in mature olfactory neurons. LBR-induced reorganization of nuclear architecture and disruption of OR aggregates perturbs the singularity of OR transcription and disrupts the targeting specificity of the olfactory neurons.

To gain insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use.

In C. elegans, reductions in IIS increase stress resistance and longevity, effects that require the IIS-inhibited FOXO protein DAF-16. The C. elegans transcription factor SKN-1 also defends against oxidative stress by mobilizing the conserved phase 2 detoxification response. Here we show that IIS not only opposes DAF-16 but also directly inhibits SKN-1 in parallel. The IIS kinases AKT-1, -2, and SGK-1 phosphorylate SKN-1, and reduced IIS leads to constitutive SKN-1 nuclear accumulation in the intestine and SKN-1 target gene activation. SKN-1 contributes to the increased stress tolerance and longevity resulting from reduced IIS and delays aging when expressed transgenically. Furthermore, SKN-1 that is constitutively active increases life span independently of DAF-16.

Expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increases during normal aging, and both of these GATA factors repress expression of elt-3, which shows a corresponding decrease in expression in old worms. elt-3 regulates a large number of downstream genes that change expression in old age, including ugt-9, col-144, and sod-3. elt-5(RNAi) and elt-6(RNAi) worms have extended longevity, indicating that elt-3, elt-5, and elt-6 play an important functional role in the aging process.

To address this question, we generated CX3CR1CreER mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase that allow for specific manipulation of gene function in microglia. Using CX3CR1 CreER to drive diphtheria toxin receptor expression in microglia, we found that microglia could be specifically depleted from the brain upon diphtheria toxin administration. Mice depleted of microglia showed deficits in multiple learning tasks and a significant reduction in motor-learning-dependent synapse formation. Furthermore, Cre-dependent removal of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from microglia largely recapitulated the effects of microglia depletion.

The basal machinery for initiation of mtDNA transcription has been molecularly defined, but the mechanisms regulating its activity are poorly understood. In this study, we show that MTERF3 is a negative regulator of mtDNA transcription initiation. The MTERF3 gene is essential because homozygous knockout mouse embryos die in midgestation. Tissue-specific inactivation of MTERF3 in the heart causes aberrant mtDNA transcription and severe respiratory chain deficiency. MTERF3 binds the mtDNA promoter region and depletion of MTERF3 increases transcription initiation on both mtDNA strands. This increased transcription initiation leads to decreased expression of critical promoter-distal tRNA genes, which is possibly explained by transcriptional collision on the circular mtDNA molecule.

Here, we report that methylation/demethylation of Polycomb 2 protein (Pc2) controls relocation of growth-control genes between Polycomb bodies (PcGs) and interchromatin granules (ICGs) in response to growth signals. This movement is the consequence of binding of methylated and unmethylated Pc2 to the ncRNAs TUG1 and MALAT1/NEAT2, located in PcGs and ICGs, respectively. These ncRNAs mediate assembly of multiple corepressors/coactivators and can serve to switch mark recognition by ""readers"" of the histone code. Additionally, binding of NEAT2 to unmethylated Pc2 promotes E2F1 SUMOylation, leading to activation of the growth-control gene program.

Here, we discover a conserved post-translational switch governing the duration of proneural protein activity that is required for proper neuronal development. Phosphorylation of a single Serine at the same position in Scute and Atonal proneural proteins governs the transition from active to inactive forms by regulating DNA binding. The equivalent Neurogenin2 Threonine also regulates DNA binding and proneural activity in the developing mammalian neocortex. Using genome editing in Drosophila, we show that Atonal outlives its mRNA but is inactivated by phosphorylation. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of the conserved proneural Serine causes quantitative changes in expression dynamics and target gene expression resulting in neuronal number and fate defects.

We report that a microRNA is part of a mechanism that makes cells sensitive to signals in the Drosophila eye. Expression of miR-7 is activated in cells as they begin differentiating into photoreceptors. This is dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling that triggers ERK-mediated degradation of the transcription factor Yan. In nonstimulated cells, Yan represses miR-7 transcription, whereas miR-7 RNA represses Yan protein expression in photoreceptors, by binding to sequences within its mRNA 3′UTR. We propose that reciprocal negative feedback between Yan and miR-7 ensures mutually exclusive expression, with Yan in progenitor cells and miR-7 in photoreceptor cells. Expression is switched when EGFR signaling transiently triggers Yan degradation.

The Ski binding surface on Smad4 significantly overlaps with that required for binding of the R-Smads. Indeed, Ski disrupts the formation of a functional complex between the Co- and R-Smads, explaining how it could lead to repression of TGF-β, activin, and BMP responses.

Just how Aire targets and induces PTA transcripts remains largely undefined. Screening via Aire-targeted coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, and validating by multiple RNAi-mediated knockdown approaches, we identified a large set of proteins that associate with Aire. They fall into four major functional classes: nuclear transport, chromatin binding/structure, transcription and pre-mRNA processing. One set of Aire interactions centered on DNA protein kinase and a group of proteins it partners with to resolve DNA double-stranded breaks or promote transcriptional elongation. Another set of interactions was focused on the pre-mRNA splicing and maturation machinery, potentially explaining the markedly more effective processing of PTA transcripts in the presence of Aire. These findings suggest a model to explain Aire's widespread targeting and induction of weakly transcribed chromatin regions. PaperClip: {An electronic component is presented}. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the widespread use of HOCl, surprisingly little is known about its mode of action. In this study, we demonstrate that low molar ratios of HOCl to protein cause oxidative protein unfolding in vitro and target thermolabile proteins for irreversible aggregation in vivo. As a defense mechanism, bacteria use the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33, which responds to bleach treatment with the reversible oxidative unfolding of its C-terminal redox switch domain. HOCl-mediated unfolding turns inactive Hsp33 into a highly active chaperone holdase, which protects essential Escherichia coli proteins against HOCl-induced aggregation and increases bacterial HOCl resistance. Our results substantially improve our molecular understanding about HOCl's functional mechanism. They suggest that the antimicrobial effects of bleach are largely based on HOCl's ability to cause aggregation of essential bacterial proteins. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We also show, by single-molecule imaging of a fluorescent ATP analog Cy3-ATP while F1 is forced to rotate slowly, that release of Cy3-ADP occurs at ∼240° after it is bound as Cy3-ATP at 0°. This and other results suggest that the affinity for ADP also decreases with rotation, and thus ADP release contributes part of energy for rotation.

Loss-of-function mutations occurred in all PKC subgroups and impeded second-messenger binding, phosphorylation, or catalysis. Correction of a loss-of-function PKCβ mutation by CRISPR-mediated genome editing in a patient-derived colon cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Hemizygous deletion promoted anchorage-independent growth, revealing that PKCβ is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Several mutations were dominant negative, suppressing global PKC signaling output, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that PKC mutations cooperate with co-occurring mutations in cancer drivers.

The sources of RAG1 mis-targeting and the mechanisms that have evolved to suppress it are poorly understood. Here, we report that RAG1 associates with chromatin at thousands of active promoters and enhancers in the genome of developing lymphocytes. The mouse and human genomes appear to have responded by reducing the abundance of ""cryptic"" recombination signals near RAG1 binding sites.

Here, we demonstrate allosteric coupling between a structured domain of a channel nucleoporin (Nup58) and its neighboring disordered domain in interaction with another channel nucleoporin (Nup54) and a transport factor (Kapb1). Analysis of multiple equilibria showed that multivalent interactions of Kapb1 with the disordered domains of Nup58 stabilize the neighboring structured domain associated with Nup54, shifting conformational equilibria from homo-oligomers to hetero-oligomers.

A mosquito homolog of human CD45 in A. aegypti, designated mosPTP-1, recruits mosGCTL-1 to enable viral attachment to cells and to enhance viral entry. In vivo experiments show that mosGCTL-1 and mosPTP-1 function as part of the same pathway and are critical for WNV infection of mosquitoes.

Upon infection, the leukocyte-specific protein coronin 1 is actively recruited to mycobacterial phagosomes, where it blocks lysosomal delivery by an unknown mechanism. Analysis of macrophages from coronin 1-deficient mice showed that coronin 1 is dispensable for F-actin-dependent processes such as phagocytosis, motility, and membrane ruffling. However, upon mycobacterial infection, coronin 1 was required for activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria. In the absence of coronin 1, calcineurin activity did not occur, resulting in lysosomal delivery and killing of mycobacteria. Furthermore, blocking calcineurin activation with cyclosporin A or FK506 led to lysosomal delivery and intracellular mycobacterial killing. These results demonstrate a role for coronin 1 in activating Ca2+ dependent signaling processes in macrophages and reveal a function for calcineurin in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion upon mycobacterial infection. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Dedicated machinery ensures that heritable effects are reset, but how the responses segregate in the population is unknown. We show that isogenic individuals differ dramatically in the persistence of transgenerational responses. By examining lineages of more than 20,000 worms, three principles emerge: (1) The silencing each mother initiates is distributed evenly among her descendants; heritable RNAi dissipates but is uniform in every generation. (2) Differences between lineages arise because the mothers that initiate heritable responses stochastically assume different “inheritance states” that determine the progeny's fate. (3) The likelihood that an RNAi response would continue to be inherited increases the more generations it lasts. The inheritance states are determined by HSF-1, which regulates silencing factors and, accordingly, small RNA levels.

Here, we present a phosphoproteomics-based systems analysis of CDK substrates in fission yeast and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of different CDK substrates can be temporally ordered during the cell cycle by a single cyclin-CDK. This is achieved by rising CDK activity and the differential sensitivity of substrates to CDK activity over a wide dynamic range.

Using a zebrafish embryo culture system with reporters of early and late skeletal muscle differentiation, we examined the influence of 2,400 chemicals on myogenesis and identified six that expanded muscle progenitors, including three GSK3β inhibitors, two calpain inhibitors, and one adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin. Forskolin also enhanced proliferation of mouse satellite cells in culture and maintained their ability to engraft muscle in vivo. A combination of bFGF, forskolin, and the GSK3β inhibitor BIO induced skeletal muscle differentiation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and produced engraftable myogenic progenitors that contributed to muscle repair in vivo. In summary, these studies reveal functionally conserved pathways regulating myogenesis across species and identify chemical compounds that expand mouse satellite cells and differentiate human iPSCs into engraftable muscle. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Xu C.; Tabebordbar M.; Iovino S.; Ciarlo C.; Liu J.; Castiglioni A.; Price E.; Liu M.; Barton E.R.; Kahn C.R.; Wagers A.J.; Zon L.I.,53.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,0.75851274,0.53211397,0.5307584,0.7559688,0.44989896,0.06427509937243348,0.3771787,0.49607265,0.0940503534599173,0.6359383,0.2783655,0.019828301175768115,0.43976554,0.35544205,0.08654357703156185,0.54226065,0.001531193032860756,0.27825161814689636

However, the neural processes that prioritize conflicting survival needs are poorly understood. We discovered that hunger attenuates behavioral responses and affective properties of inflammatory pain without altering acute nociceptive responses. This effect is centrally controlled, as activity in hunger-sensitive agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons abrogates inflammatory pain. Systematic analysis of AgRP projection subpopulations revealed that the neural processing of hunger and inflammatory pain converge in the hindbrain parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Strikingly, activity in AgRP → PBN neurons blocked the behavioral response to inflammatory pain as effectively as hunger or analgesics. The anti-nociceptive effect of hunger is mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling in the PBN. By investigating the intersection between hunger and pain, we have identified a neural circuit that mediates competing survival needs and uncovered NPY Y1 receptor signaling in the PBN as a target for pain suppression.

Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) is known to have a conserved role in aging and cellular mechanisms against stress. In C. elegans, genetic studies suggest that heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 is required for IIS to modulate longevity. Here, we report that the activity of HSF-1 is regulated by IIS. This regulation occurs at an early step of HSF-1 activation via two HSF-1 regulators, DDL-1 and DDL-2. Inhibition of DDL-1/2 increases longevity and thermotolerance in an hsf-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, biochemical analyses suggest that DDL-1/2 negatively regulate HSF-1 activity by forming a protein complex with HSF-1. The formation of this complex (DHIC) is affected by the phosphorylation status of DDL-1. Both the formation of DHIC and the phosphorylation of DDL-1 are controlled by IIS.

Here, we found that the Drosophila CPEB Orb2 forms amyloid-like oligomers, and oligomers are enriched in the synaptic membrane fraction. Of the two protein isoforms of Orb2, the amyloid-like oligomer formation is dependent on the Orb2A form. A point mutation in the prion-like domain of Orb2A, which reduced amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2, did not interfere with learning or memory persisting up to 24 hr.

Although thermodynamic instability of the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of ΔF508 CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) partly accounts for the mutant channel degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum and is considered as a drug target in cystic fibrosis, the link between NBD1 and CFTR misfolding remains unclear. Here, we show that ΔF508 destabilizes NBD1 both thermodynamically and kinetically, but correction of either defect alone is insufficient to restore ΔF508 CFTR biogenesis. Instead, both ΔF508-NBD1 energetic and the NBD1-MSD2 (membrane-spanning domain 2) interface stabilization are required for wild-type-like folding, processing, and transport function, suggesting a synergistic role of NBD1 energetics and topology in CFTR-coupled domain assembly.

Neural precursor cell dysfunction and white matter dysfunction are thought to contribute to this debilitating syndrome. Here, we demonstrate persistent depletion of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in humans who received chemotherapy. Developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapy-induced neurological dysfunction, we find a similar depletion of white matter OPCs, increased but incomplete OPC differentiation, and a persistent deficit in myelination. OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy.

These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception.

TRF2 and Apollo also suppress damage to engineered interstitial telomere repeat tracts that were inserted far away from chromosome ends. Genetic data indicate that DNA topoisomerase 2α acts in the same pathway of telomere protection as TRF2 and Apollo. Moreover, TRF2, which binds preferentially to positively supercoiled DNA substrates, together with Apollo, negatively regulates the amount of TOP1, TOP2α, and TOP2β at telomeres.

We identify m6A sites on many clock gene transcripts and show that specific inhibition of m 6A methylation by silencing of the m6A methylase Mettl3 is sufficient to elicit circadian period elongation and RNA processing delay. Analysis of the circadian nucleocytoplasmic distribution of clock genes Per2 and Arntl then revealed an uncoupling between steady-state pre-mRNA and cytoplasmic mRNA rhythms when m6A methylation is inhibited. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,Fustin J.-M.; Doi M.; Yamaguchi Y.; Hida H.; Nishimura S.; Yoshida M.; Isagawa T.; Morioka M.S.; Kakeya H.; Manabe I.; Okamura H.,42.0,718170981.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2013,8,1.5583005,0.6739361,0.61991197,1.5129042,0.4591428,0.08547026594650187,0.4399354,0.45826507,0.07431391081592875,0.57534236,0.45434356,0.09421249079461619,0.70264,0.50548255,0.12395673843540383,0.41548297,0.4946054518222809,0.2044820785522461

However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function, and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. Here, we find that architectural constraints on noise suppression are overcome to stabilize fate commitment. Using single-molecule and time-lapse imaging, we find that—after a noise-driven event—human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly attenuates expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established through a serial cascade of post-transcriptional splicing, whereby proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor unspliced mRNAs. Strikingly, this auto-depletion circuitry minimizes noise to stabilize HIV's commitment decision, and a noise-suppression molecule promotes stabilization. This feedback mechanism for noise suppression suggests a functional role for delayed splicing in other systems and may represent a generalizable architecture of diverse homeostatic signaling circuits.

We postulate that TNBC might be highly dependent on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of transcription. Utilizing kinase inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we show here that triple-negative but not hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells are exceptionally dependent on CDK7, a transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase. TNBC cells are unique in their dependence on this transcriptional CDK and suffer apoptotic cell death upon CDK7 inhibition.

Here, we report that TTP (SH3BP4), a SH3-containing protein, specifically regulates the internalization of the transferrin receptor (TfR). TTP interacts with endocytic proteins, including clathrin, dynamin, and the TfR, and localizes selectively to TfR-containing coated-pits (CCP) and -vesicles (CCV). Overexpression of TTP specifically inhibits TfR internalization, and causes the formation of morphologically aberrant CCP, which are probably fission impaired. This effect is mediated by the SH3 of TTP, which can bind to dynamin, and it is rescued by overexpression of dynamin. Functional ablation of TTP causes a reduction in TfR internalization, and reduced cargo loading and size of TfR-CCV. Tyrosine phosphorylation of either TTP or dynamin prevents their interaction, pointing to a possible mechanism of exclusion of TTP from some CCP. Thus, TTP might represent one of the long sought for molecules that allow cargo-specific control of clathrin endocytosis. ©2005 Elsevier Inc.",,Tosoni D.; Puri C.; Confalonieri S.; Salcini A.E.; De Camilli P.; Tacchetti C.; Di Fiore P.P.,38.0,1029579.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2005,8,0.6723948,0.4581951,0.50983596,0.78691643,0.46512938,0.06749788407462032,0.5041805,0.49523294,0.10437670418100731,0.63556486,0.45430112,0.08648224396932763,0.560023,0.41961658,0.0900693309686893,0.5827648,0.14416570961475372,0.3594152629375458

During this transition, the embryo must establish a paracellular permeability barrier to enable expansion of the blastocyst cavity. Here, using live imaging of mouse embryos, we reveal an actin-zippering mechanism driving this embryo sealing. Preceding blastocyst stage, a cortical F-actin ring assembles at the apical pole of the embryo's outer cells. The ring structure forms when cortical actin flows encounter a network of polar microtubules that exclude F-actin. Unlike stereotypical actin rings, the actin rings of the mouse embryo are not contractile, but instead, they expand to the cell-cell junctions. Here, they couple to the junctions by recruiting and stabilizing adherens and tight junction components. Coupling of the actin rings triggers localized myosin II accumulation, and it initiates a tension-dependent zippering mechanism along the junctions that is required to seal the embryo for blastocyst formation.

One approach to assess potential immunogens is to use mice expressing precursors of human bnAbs as vaccination models.

Mammalian centromeres are specified epigenetically, with all active centromeres containing centromere-specific chromatin in which CENP-A replaces histone H3 within the nucleosome. The proteins responsible for assembly of human CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle are shown here to be distinct from the chromatin assembly factors previously shown to load other histone H3 variants. Here we demonstrate that prenucleosomal CENP-A is complexed with histone H4, nucleophosmin 1, and HJURP. Recruitment of new CENP-A into nucleosomes at replicated centromeres is dependent on HJURP. Recognition by HJURP is mediated through the centromere targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A, a region that we demonstrated previously to induce a unique conformational rigidity to both the subnucleosomal CENP-A heterotetramer and the corresponding assembled nucleosome.

Paradoxically, telomere function depends on checkpoint proteins such as ATM and ATR, but a molecular model explaining this seemingly contradictory relationship has been missing so far. Here we show that the DNA damage machinery acts on telomeres in at least two independent steps. First, the ATR-dependent machinery is recruited to telomeres before telomere replication is completed, likely in response to single-stranded DNA resulting from replication fork stalling. Second, after replication, telomeres attract ATM and the homologous recombination (HR) machinery. In vivo and in vitro results suggest that the HR machinery is required for formation of a telomere-specific structure at chromosome ends after replication.

We discovered that the evolutionarily conserved Caenorhabditis elegans gene acdh-11 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [ACDH]) facilitates heat adaptation by regulating the lipid desaturase FAT-7. Human ACDH deficiency causes the most common inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation, with syndromes that are exacerbated by hyperthermia. Heat upregulates acdh-11 expression to decrease fat-7 expression. We solved the high-resolution crystal structure of ACDH-11 and established the molecular basis of its selective and high-affinity binding to C11/C12-chain fatty acids. ACDH-11 sequesters C11/C12-chain fatty acids and prevents these fatty acids from activating nuclear hormone receptors and driving fat-7 expression. Thus, the ACDH-11 pathway drives heat adaptation by linking temperature shifts to regulation of lipid desaturase levels and membrane fluidity via an unprecedented mode of fatty acid signaling.",,Ma D.K.; Li Z.; Lu A.Y.; Sun F.; Chen S.; Rothe M.; Menzel R.; Sun F.; Horvitz H.R.,65.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2015,8,0.60684294,0.41673118,0.41734236,0.58180964,0.32747364,0.026137849510229294,0.5203736,0.47909963,0.09912556391731986,0.59502316,0.2731979,0.06367465484228307,0.60504353,0.37642384,0.08022460213986432,0.52996165,0.38380804657936096,0.23713280260562897

Here, we demonstrate that the impairment of spatial working memory (SWM) and in vivo long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, induced by an acute exposure of exogenous cannabinoids, is fully abolished in conditional mutant mice lacking type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in brain astroglial cells but is conserved in mice lacking CB1R in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Blockade of neuronal glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and of synaptic trafficking of glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR) also abolishes cannabinoid effects on SWM and LTD induction and expression. We conclude that the impairment of working memory by marijuana and cannabinoids is due to the activation of astroglial CB 1R and is associated with astroglia-dependent hippocampal LTD in vivo.

However, structural analyses to date have focused on how SF1A helicases achieve 3′-5′ movement along nucleic acids. We present crystal structures of the complex between the SF1B helicase RecD2 from Deinococcus radiodurans and ssDNA in the presence and absence of an ATP analog. These snapshots of the reaction pathway reveal a nucleotide binding-induced conformational change of the two motor domains that is broadly reminiscent of changes observed in other SF1 and SF2 helicases. Together with biochemical data, the structures point to a step size for translocation of one base per ATP hydrolyzed. Moreover, the structures also reveal a mechanism for nucleic acid translocation in the 5′-3′ direction by SF1B helicases that is surprisingly different from that of 3′-5′ translocation by SF1A enzymes, and explains the molecular basis of directionality. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Whether differentiated cells themselves can contribute to cell replacement and tissue regeneration is a controversial question. Here, we show that differentiated heart muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, can be induced to proliferate and regenerate. We identify an underlying molecular mechanism for controlling this process that involves the growth factor neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, ErbB4. NRG1 induces mononucleated, but not binucleated, cardiomyocytes to divide. In vivo, genetic inactivation of ErbB4 reduces cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas increasing ErbB4 expression enhances it. Injecting NRG1 in adult mice induces cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity and promotes myocardial regeneration, leading to improved function after myocardial infarction. Undifferentiated progenitor cells did not contribute to NRG1-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Thus, increasing the activity of the NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway may provide a molecular strategy to promote myocardial regeneration. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that a significant fraction of mature ATM-deficient lymphocytes contain telomere-deleted ends produced by failed end joining during V(D)J recombination. These RAG-1/2 endonuclease-dependent, terminally deleted chromosomes persist in peripheral lymphocytes for at least 2 weeks in vivo and are stable over several generations in vitro. Restoration of ATM kinase activity in mature lymphocytes that have transiently lost ATM function leads to loss of cells with terminally deleted chromosomes. Thus, maintenance of genomic stability in lymphocytes requires faithful end joining as well a checkpoint that prevents the long-term persistence and transmission of DSBs.

In contrast, nef alleles from HIV-1 and a subset of closely related SIVs fail to downregulate TCR-CD3 and to inhibit cell death. Thus, Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation is a fundamental property of primate lentiviruses that likely evolved to maintain viral persistence in the context of an intact host immune system.

We show here that the S. pombe JmjC-domain protein Lid2 is a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase responsible for H3K4 hypomethylation in heterochromatin. Lid2 interacts with the histone lysine-9 methyltransferase, Clr4, through the Dos1/Clr8-Rik1 complex, which also functions in the RNA interference pathway. Disruption of the JmjC domain alone results in severe heterochromatin defects and depletion of siRNA, whereas overexpressing Lid2 enhances heterochromatin silencing. The physical and functional link between H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation suggests that the two reactions act in a coordinated manner. Surprisingly, crossregulation of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in euchromatin also requires Lid2.

This mobilization regimen results in preferential trafficking of stem cells that demonstrate a higher engraftment efficiency than those mobilized by G-CSF.

BCAR4 binding of SNIP1 and PNUTS in response to CCL21 releases the SNIP1's inhibition of p300-dependent histone acetylation, which in turn enables the BCAR4-recruited PNUTS to bind H3K18ac and relieve inhibition of RNA Pol II via activation of the PP1 phosphatase.

SHBG is believed to keep sex steroids inactive and to control the amount of free hormones that enter cells by passive diffusion. Contrary to the free hormone hypothesis, we demonstrate that megalin, an endocytic receptor in reproductive tissues, acts as a pathway for cellular uptake of biologically active androgens and estrogens bound to SHBG. In line with this function, lack of receptor expression in megalin knockout mice results in impaired descent of the testes into the scrotum in males and blockade of vagina opening in females. Both processes are critically dependent on sex-steroid signaling, and similar defects are seen in animals treated with androgen- or estrogen-receptor antagonists.

Here, we present atomic models of two F family pili, the F and pED208 pili, generated from cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions at 5.0 and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. These structures reveal that conjugative pili are assemblies of stoichiometric protein-phospholipid units. We further demonstrate that each pilus type binds preferentially to particular phospholipids. These structures provide the molecular basis for F pilus assembly and also shed light on the remarkable properties of conjugative pili in bacterial secretion and phage infection.",Conjugation; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Phospholipid; Pilus; Protein-phospholipid complex; Structural Biology; Type 4 Secretion System,Costa T.R.D.; Ilangovan A.; Ukleja M.; Redzej A.; Santini J.M.; Smith T.K.; Egelman E.H.; Waksman G.,40.0,726724489.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2016,9,0.445598,0.41326424,0.4014682,0.43308514,0.454754,0.07869667047170004,0.635763,0.43978572,0.07297440832006358,0.6685712,0.41144228,0.06411743851312296,0.6406929,0.492419,0.11419690420694045,0.6214612,0.5263276100158691,-0.03750690072774887

Recently, the midbody ring became known as central for abscission, but its regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we identify BRUCE, a 528 kDa multifunctional protein, which processes ubiquitin-conjugating activity, as a major regulator of abscission. During cytokinesis, BRUCE moves from the vesicular system to the midbody ring and serves as a platform for the membrane delivery machinery and mitotic regulators. Depletion of BRUCE in cell cultures causes defective abscission and cytokinesis-associated apoptosis, accompanied by a block of vesicular targeting and defective formation of the midbody and the midbody ring. Notably, ubiquitin relocalizes from midbody microtubules to the midbody ring during cytokinesis, and depletion of BRUCE disrupts this process.

Using Bacillus subtilis and its lytic phage SPP1, we demonstrate that R cells, lacking SPP1 receptor, can be lysed by SPP1 when co-cultured with S cells. This unanticipated lysis was triggered in part by phage lytic enzymes released from nearby infected cells. Strikingly, we discovered that occasionally phages can invade R cells, a phenomenon we termed acquisition of sensitivity (ASEN). We found that ASEN is mediated by R cells transiently gaining phage attachment molecules from neighboring S cells and provide evidence that this molecular exchange is driven by membrane vesicles.

Moreover, the N terminus of the Eater protein mediated direct microbial binding which could be inhibited with scavenger receptor ligands, acetylated, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein.

Here, we show that modulation of circadian glucocorticoid oscillation by enhancing its amplitude leads to anxiolytic-like behavior.

This behavioral change was found to be dependent on the higher amplitude of glucocorticoid oscillation, although the total glucocorticoid secretion is not increased in these mice. Genetic and pharmacologic experiments demonstrated that intermediate opioid peptides secreted from SCH activate CXCR7, a β-arrestin-biased G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), to augment circadian oscillation of glucocorticoid levels in a paracrine manner. Furthermore, recapitulating this paracrine axis by subcutaneous administration of a synthetic CXCR7 ligand is sufficient to induce anxiolytic-like behavior.

Upon genotoxic stress, a complex between PIDD, the kinase RIP1, and a component of the NF-κB-activating kinase complex, NEMO, is formed. PIDD expression enhances genotoxic-stress-induced NF-κB activation through augmented sumoylation and ubiquitination of NEMO.

We investigate how each nucleosomal component - the histone tails, the specific histone-DNA contacts, and the DNA sequence - contributes to the strength of the barrier. Removal of the tails favors progression of RNA polymerase II into the entry region of the nucleosome by locally increasing the wrapping-unwrapping rates of the DNA around histones. In contrast, point mutations that affect histone-DNA contacts at the dyad abolish the barrier to transcription in the central region by decreasing the local wrapping rate. Moreover, we show that the nucleosome amplifies sequence-dependent transcriptional pausing, an effect mediated through the structure of the nascent RNA. Each of these nucleosomal elements controls transcription elongation by affecting distinctly the density and duration of polymerase pauses, thus providing multiple and alternative mechanisms for control of gene expression by chromatin remodeling and transcription factors.

Mus81-Mms4 is hyperactivated by Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation in meiosis I, generating the crossovers necessary for chromosome segregation. Yen1 is also tightly regulated and is activated in meiosis II to resolve persistent Holliday junctions. In yeast and human mitotic cells, a similar regulatory network restrains these nuclease activities until mitosis, biasing the outcome of recombination toward noncrossover products while also ensuring the elimination of any persistent joint molecules. Mitotic regulation thereby facilitates chromosome segregation while limiting the potential for loss of heterozygosity and sister-chromatid exchanges. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,Matos J.; Blanco M.G.; Maslen S.; Skehel J.M.; West S.C.,59.0,13339982.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2011,8,1.1569427,0.6194424,0.58469254,1.1113428,0.4477048,0.06410016692684789,0.5080441,0.43170285,0.058897238275432306,0.68886495,0.378343,0.07232192259692832,0.37361562,0.4668393,0.1124001158183397,0.5357558,0.42545264959335327,0.18990524113178253

Bacteria-induced neuroprotection relied on activation of gut-projecting sympathetic neurons and signaling via β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) on MMs. In contrast, helminth-mediated neuroprotection was dependent on T cells and systemic production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by eosinophils, which induced arginase-expressing MMs that prevented neuronal loss from an unrelated infection located in a different intestinal region.

We identified a pathway defined by two kinases, LKB1 and NUAK1, required for cortical axon branching in vivo. Conditional deletion of LKB1 after axon specification or knockdown of NUAK1 drastically reduced axon branching in vivo, whereas their overexpression was sufficient to increase axon branching. The LKB1-NUAK1 pathway controls mitochondria immobilization in axons. Using manipulation of Syntaphilin, a protein necessary and sufficient to arrest mitochondrial transport specifically in the axon, we demonstrate that the LKB1-NUAK1 kinase pathway regulates axon branching by promoting mitochondria immobilization. Finally, we show that LKB1 and NUAK1 are necessary and sufficient to immobilize mitochondria specifically at nascent presynaptic sites. Our results unravel a link between presynaptic mitochondrial capture and axon branching.

By comparing TOP1 occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) versus TOP1 activity using topoisomerase 1 sequencing (TOP1-seq), a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. TOP1 stimulation is strongly dependent on the kinase activity of BRD4, a protein that phosphorylates Ser2-CTD and regulates RNAPII pause-release. Thus the coordinated action of BRD4 and TOP1 overcame the torsional stress opposing transcription as RNAPII commenced elongation but preserved negative supercoiling that assists promoter melting at start sites.

Herein, we report the identification of a novel protein termed MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling), which mediates the activation of NF-κB and IRF3 in response to viral infection. Silencing of MAVS expression through RNA interference abolishes the activation of NF-κB and IRF3 by viruses, thereby permitting viral replication. Conversely, overexpression of MAVS induces the expression of IFN-β through activation of NF-κB and IRF3, thus boosting antiviral immunity. Epistasis experiments show that MAVS is required for the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IκB and functions downstream of RIG-I, an intracellular receptor for viral RNA. MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, both of which are essential for MAVS signaling. The transmembrane domain targets MAVS to the mitochondria, implicating a new role of mitochondria in innate immunity.

We found that acute ablation of cyclin A in fibroblasts did not affect cell proliferation, but led to prolonged expression of another cyclin, cyclin E, across the cell cycle. However, combined ablation of all A- and E-type cyclins extinguished cell division. In contrast, cyclin A function was essential for cell-cycle progression of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells.

We present evidence that Pax3, but not Pax7, is regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation during adult muscle stem cell activation. Intriguingly, only monoubiquitinated forms of Pax3 could be detected. Mutation of two specific lysine residues in the C-terminal region of Pax3 reduced the extent of its monoubiquitination and susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, whereas introduction of a key lysine into the C-terminal region of Pax7 rendered that protein susceptible to monoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Monoubiquitinated Pax3 was shuttled to the intrinsic proteasomal protein S5a by interacting specifically with the ubiquitin-binding protein Rad23B. Functionally, sustained expression of Pax3 proteins inhibited myogenic differentiation, demonstrating that Pax3 degradation is an essential step for the progression of the myogenic program.

This integrated genomic approach revealed an unexpected utilization of immuno-regulatory signals by pancreatic cancer epithelial cells. In particular, the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ), known to drive inflammation and T cell differentiation, was upregulated during pancreatic cancer progression, and its genetic or pharmacologic inhibition led to a striking defect in pancreatic cancer growth and a marked improvement in survival. Further, a large-scale retrospective analysis in patients revealed that RORγ expression may predict pancreatic cancer aggressiveness, as it positively correlated with advanced disease and metastasis.

Of particular concern, no new antibiotic classes have been approved for treating Gram-negative pathogens in decades. Here, we characterize a compound, SCH-79797, that kills both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through a unique dual-targeting mechanism of action (MoA) with undetectably low resistance frequencies. To characterize its MoA, we combined quantitative imaging, proteomic, genetic, metabolomic, and cell-based assays. This pipeline demonstrates that SCH-79797 has two independent cellular targets, folate metabolism and bacterial membrane integrity, and outperforms combination treatments in killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) persisters. Building on the molecular core of SCH-79797, we developed a derivative, Irresistin-16, with increased potency and showed its efficacy against Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a mouse vaginal infection model.

How might detrimental escalation of TRPV1 activity be counteracted? Using a genetic-proteomic approach, we identify the GABAB1 receptor subunit as bona fide inhibitor of TRPV1 sensitization in the context of diverse inflammatory settings. We find that the endogenous GABAB agonist, GABA, is released from nociceptive nerve terminals, suggesting an autocrine feedback mechanism limiting TRPV1 sensitization. The effect of GABAB on TRPV1 is independent of canonical G protein signaling and rather relies on close juxtaposition of the GABAB1 receptor subunit and TRPV1.

However, the underlying mechanisms of myelin wrapping have remained unclear. Using an integrative approach of live imaging, electron microscopy, and genetics, we show that new myelin membranes are incorporated adjacent to the axon at the innermost tongue. Simultaneously, newly formed layers extend laterally, ultimately leading to the formation of a set of closely apposed paranodal loops. An elaborated system of cytoplasmic channels within the growing myelin sheath enables membrane trafficking to the leading edge. Most of these channels close with ongoing development but can be reopened in adults by experimentally raising phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate levels, which reinitiates myelin growth. Our model can explain assembly of myelin as a multilayered structure, abnormal myelin outfoldings in neurological disease, and plasticity of myelin biogenesis observed in adult life.

In addition to these postnatal functions, maternal osteocalcin crosses the placenta during pregnancy and prevents neuronal apoptosis before embryos synthesize this hormone. As a result, the severity of the neuroanatomical defects and learning and memory deficits of Osteocalcin-/- mice is determined by the maternal genotype, and delivering osteocalcin to pregnant Osteocalcin -/- mothers rescues these abnormalities in their Osteocalcin -/- progeny.

The enzyme cGAS is a sensor of cytosolic DNA that induces interferon and inflammatory responses that can be protective or pathologic, depending on the context. Along with other cytosolic innate immune receptors, cGAS is thought to diffuse throughout the cytosol in search of its DNA ligand. Herein, we report that cGAS is not a cytosolic protein but rather localizes to the plasma membrane via the actions of an N-terminal phosphoinositide-binding domain. This domain interacts selectively with PI(4,5)P2, and cGAS mutants defective for lipid binding are mislocalized to the cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Mislocalized cGAS induces potent interferon responses to genotoxic stress, but weaker responses to viral infection. These data establish the subcellular positioning of a cytosolic innate immune receptor as a mechanism that governs self-nonself discrimination.

However, the competing demands of nonself discrimination and self-recognition place limitations on the mechanisms by which homophilic recognition units can function. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,Thu C.A.; Chen W.V.; Rubinstein R.; Chevee M.; Wolcott H.N.; Felsovalyi K.O.; Tapia J.C.; Shapiro L.; Honig B.; Maniatis T.,42.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2014,7,0.49389628,0.37835985,0.3801989,0.48245442,0.44333088,0.08075001795687009,0.5650393,0.48745775,0.08908087992222091,0.5060067,0.40512204,0.1018680129211782,0.61221087,0.31444836,0.03422397870366867,0.5821425,0.2503328025341034,0.3533102571964264

Activation of OGT diminishes mitochondrial motility. We establish the mitochondrial motor-adaptor protein Milton as a required substrate for OGT to arrest mitochondrial motility by mapping and mutating the key O-GlcNAcylated serine residues.

The identity of the PAM and the PAM-proximal nucleotides control Cas3 recruitment by releasing the Cse1 subunit.

Activity-dependent transport of synaptically localized transcriptional regulators provides a direct means of coupling synaptic stimulation with changes in transcription.

We show that CRTC1 localizes to synapses in silenced hippocampal neurons but translocates to the nucleus in response to localized synaptic stimulation. Regulated nuclear translocation occurs only in excitatory neurons and requires calcium influx and calcineurin activation. CRTC1 is controlled in a dual fashion with activity regulating CRTC1 nuclear translocation and cAMP modulating its persistence in the nucleus.

Our structure identifies candidate genes for diagnosis of ciliopathies and provides a framework to understand their functions in driving ciliary motility.",axonemal dyneins; ciliary motility; ciliopathies; cryo-EM; doublet microtubules; microtubule inner proteins,Gui M.; Farley H.; Anujan P.; Anderson J.R.; Maxwell D.W.; Whitchurch J.B.; Botsch J.J.; Qiu T.; Meleppattu S.; Singh S.K.; Zhang Q.; Thompson J.; Lucas J.S.; Bingle C.D.; Norris D.P.; Roy S.; Brown A.,131.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2021,8,0.33868355,0.38628164,0.38149697,0.3076181,0.49480307,0.09519814794871612,0.48580506,0.48182154,0.07710333677855302,0.55005825,0.45522702,0.09184532734917861,0.63780475,0.4278437,0.099587109181557,0.577429,0.5068304538726807,0.1792575865983963

When cancer is the outcome, we are afforded a glimpse into these processes by the clonal expansion of the malignant cell. Here, we characterize a less explored layer of the mutational landscape of cancer: mutational asymmetries between the two DNA strands. Analyzing whole-genome sequences of 590 tumors from 14 different cancer types, we reveal widespread asymmetries across mutagenic processes, with transcriptional (""T-class"") asymmetry dominating UV-, smoking-, and liver-cancer-associated mutations and replicative (""R-class"") asymmetry dominating POLE-, APOBEC-, and MSI-associated mutations. We report a striking phenomenon of transcription-coupled damage (TCD) on the non-transcribed DNA strand and provide evidence that APOBEC mutagenesis occurs on the lagging-strand template during DNA replication. As more genomes are sequenced, studying and classifying their asymmetries will illuminate the underlying biological mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.",,Haradhvala N.J.; Polak P.; Stojanov P.; Covington K.R.; Shinbrot E.; Hess J.M.; Rheinbay E.; Kim J.; Maruvka Y.E.; Braunstein L.Z.; Kamburov A.; Hanawalt P.C.; Wheeler D.A.; Koren A.; Lawrence M.S.; Getz G.,68.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2016,8,0.8872618,0.5994952,0.5845108,0.9759247,0.4566126,0.03832442991994722,0.5192482,0.48384118,0.08900631610578347,0.4776286,0.43591,0.07820122394003931,0.519247,0.44598567,0.09923680138723051,0.4103572,0.14737072587013245,-0.4224700629711151

Although much research has focused on mechanisms that regulate initiation of replication, mechanisms that regulate elongation of replication are less well understood. We characterized a mechanism that regulates replication elongation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Replication elongation was inhibited within minutes after amino acid starvation, regardless of where the replication forks were located on the chromosome. We found that small nucleotides ppGpp and pppGpp, which are induced upon starvation, appeared to inhibit replication directly by inhibiting primase, an essential component of the replication machinery. The replication forks arrested with (p)ppGpp did not recruit the recombination protein RecA, indicating that the forks are not disrupted. (p)ppGpp appear to be part of a surveillance mechanism that links nutrient availability to replication by rapidly inhibiting replication in starved cells, thereby preventing replication-fork disruption.

Despite the long-standing connection between these organelles, the function(s) of lysosomes required to sustain mitochondrial health remains unclear. Here, working in yeast, we show that the lysosome-like vacuole maintains mitochondrial respiration by spatially compartmentalizing amino acids. Defects in vacuole function result in a breakdown in intracellular amino acid homeostasis, which drives age-related mitochondrial decline. Among amino acids, we find that cysteine is most toxic for mitochondria and show that elevated non-vacuolar cysteine impairs mitochondrial respiration by limiting intracellular iron availability through an oxidant-based mechanism. Cysteine depletion or iron supplementation restores mitochondrial health in vacuole-impaired cells and prevents mitochondrial decline during aging. These results demonstrate that cysteine toxicity is a major driver of age-related mitochondrial deterioration and identify vacuolar amino acid compartmentation as a cellular strategy to minimize amino acid toxicity.",aging; amino acid; cysteine; iron; lysosome; mitochondria; V-ATPase; vacuole; yeast,Hughes C.E.; Coody T.K.; Jeong M.-Y.; Berg J.A.; Winge D.R.; Hughes A.L.,110.0,737249122.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2020,7,0.6982126,0.42281964,0.37386867,0.64215463,0.4125973,0.0757297857334267,0.51802605,0.4284054,0.06301916860767859,0.57844967,0.4158646,0.06778198631314658,0.53525853,0.28297877,0.010471932609990686,0.59117126,0.3808210492134094,0.1721755862236023

Herein we describe a mouse model of liver cancer initiated from progenitor cells harboring defined cancer-predisposing lesions. Genome-wide analyses of tumors in this mouse model and in human hepatocellular carcinomas revealed a recurrent amplification at mouse chromosome 9qA1, the syntenic region of human chromosome 11q22. Gene-expression analyses delineated cIAP1, a known inhibitor of apoptosis, and Yap, a transcription factor, as candidate oncogenes in the amplicon. In the genetic context of their amplification, both cIAP1 and Yap accelerated tumorigenesis and were required to sustain rapid growth of amplicon-containing tumors. Furthermore, cIAP1 and Yap cooperated to promote tumorigenesis. Our results establish a tractable model of liver cancer, identify two oncogenes that cooperate by virtue of their coamplification in the same genomic locus, and suggest an efficient strategy for the annotation of human cancer genes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.
